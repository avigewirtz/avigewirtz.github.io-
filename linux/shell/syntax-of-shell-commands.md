# Syntax of Shell Commands

Commands issued in the shell typically consist of a _command name_ followed by one or more _arguments_.&#x20;

## **Command name**

A command name normally represents either an executable file somewhere in the filesystem or a shell builtin. However, it can also represent a function.&#x20;

* **Executable file**: The executable file can either be a OS utility program or a user-written program. Fundamentally there is no difference between the two. expect when invoking a user-written program, you typicaslly need to provide the pathname of the program, instead of just its name like with utility programs. More on that later.&#x20;
* **Shell Built-in**: A shell builtin is a utility implemented within the shell. The practical distinction between the two is normally irelevant,.

## **Argument**

An argument is a parameter passed to the executable file or shell built-in.  An argument is typically an _option_ or an _operand_, but it can also be an option argument.&#x20;

* **Option**: An option is generally a character prefixed by a dash that changes the command's default behavior. Many commands allow several options to be used together.&#x20;
* **Operand**: An operand generally specifies the data the command should manipulate or operate on. An operand normally represents either a filename, literal, or variable. Many commands allow multiple operands to be supplied together.&#x20;

The syntax is summarized in Figure 1.&#x20;

## Examples of Shell Commands&#x20;

### Shell prompt

Every shell displays a prompt on the command line. On armlab, the shell prompt looks like the following:

The prompt is generated by Bash, indicating its readiness to accept a command. It also provides useful information, such as the hostname of the computer you are logged into (armlab01 or armlab02), the working directory you are currently in (by default your home directory, which is represented by [\~](../../bash/useful-command-line-features.md#tilde-expansion)), and your access level ($ for ordinary users, # for the system administrator). Generalizing, the Bash prompt on armlab has the following format:&#x20;

Let's begin by breaking down commands you're already familiar with.&#x20;

```bash
javac hello.java
```

`javac` is the Java compiler that translates Java source code into Java Bytecode. The shell interprets `javac` as an executable program, and `hello.java` as the argument to this program. The shell uses a system call to create a new process and then loads the `javac` program into the new process's memory. `javac` then reads the `hello.java` file and compiles it into Java Bytecode, creating a file named `Hello.class`.

Let's begin by breaking down commands you're already familiar with.&#x20;

```bash
java Hello 
```

`java` is the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) that executes Java Bytecode. The shell interprets `java` as an executable program, and `Hello` as the argument to this program. The shell uses a system call to create a new process and then loads the `java` program into the new process's memory. `java` then reads the H`ello.class` file and executes the Java Bytecode contained within.

```bash
gcc217 hello.c -o hello
```

`gcc` is the GNU Compiler Collection, a compiler for various programming languages including C. The shell interprets `gcc` as an executable program, and `hello.c`, `-o`, and `hello` as arguments to this program. The shell uses a system call to create a new process and then loads the `gcc` program into the new process's memory. `gcc` then reads the `hello.c` file and compiles it into an executable file named `hello`.

```bash
./hello
```

`./hello` is a command to execute the `hello` program in the current directory. The `.` in `./` specifies the current directory, and `/hello` is the program to run. The shell uses a system call to create a new process and then loads the `hello` program into the new process's memory. The `hello` program then runs.
