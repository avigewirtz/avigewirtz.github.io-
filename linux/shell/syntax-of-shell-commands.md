# Syntax of Shell Commands

Commands issued in the shell typically consist of a _command name_ followed by one or more _arguments_.&#x20;

## **Command name**

A command name typically represents either an executable file, a shell built-in, or a function.&#x20;

* **Executable file**: The executable file can be any executable file on the filesystem, be it a pre-installed program, called a utility, or a user-written program. However, in the context of Fundamentally there is no difference between the two, except that when invoking a user-written program, you typically need to provide the pathname of the program so the shell can locate it. More on this later.&#x20;
* **Shell built-in**: A shell built-in is a utility implemented within the shell. The difference between a shell built-in and an executable file is that a built-in is a feature of the shell itself, while an executable is written by others. The practical implications of this are typically not of concern to the programmers, so we will not cover it here. However, whenever the distinction is pertinent, we will clearly point it out.&#x20;
* **Function**: A function is essentially a group of commands that are defined for reuse. You need now be familiar with them in COS217.&#x20;

## **Argument**

An argument is a parameter passed to the executable file, shell built-in, or function represented by the command name. An argument is typically an _option_ or an _operand_, but it can also be an _option argument_.&#x20;

*   **Option**: An option is an argument that changes the command's default behavior. An option normally consists of a single character prefixed by a hyphen (e.g., `-a`), but it can also consist of a full word prefixed by two hyphens (i.e., `--list`). The former is called a _short option_, and the latter is called a _long option_. &#x20;

    Options are defined and interpreted by the program they are supplied to. Thus, the precise syntax and behavior of an option are dependent on the program, not the shell. Many commands allow several short options to be combined.&#x20;
* **Option argument**: Certain options require an argument. For example, the `-o` option of the`gcc` command requires an argumentâ€”an output filename such as `hello`.
* **Operand**: An operand specifies the data the command should manipulate or operate on, which normally represents either a filename, literal, or variable. Many commands allow multiple operands to be supplied together.&#x20;

The syntax of a shell command can be summarized as follows:
