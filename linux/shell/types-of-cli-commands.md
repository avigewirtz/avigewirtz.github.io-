# Types of CLI Commands



Shell commands can be categorized into various types:

* **File Operations**: These are commands used for creating, deleting, viewing, and manipulating files and directories. Examples include `ls` (list directory contents), `cd` (change directory), `rm` (remove files or directories), `cp` (copy files or directories), `mv` (move or rename files), and `cat` (concatenate and display file content).
* **Process Control**: These commands control the execution of processes. Examples include `ps` (display current processes), `kill` (terminate a process), `bg` (put a process in the background), `fg` (bring a process to the foreground), and `top` or `htop` (display dynamic real-time view of running processes).
* **Text Processing**: These commands manipulate text, either within files or produced by other programs. Examples include `grep` (search text using patterns), `awk` (pattern scanning and processing language), `sed` (stream editor for filtering and transforming text), `cut` (remove sections from lines of files), and `sort` (sort lines in text files).
* **Networking**: These commands are used for network interactions. Examples include `ping` (send ICMP ECHO\_REQUEST to network hosts), `ssh` (secure shell remote login), `netstat` (network statistics), `curl` (transfer data from or to a server), and `wget` (non-interactive download of files from the web).
* **System Information**: These commands provide information about the system or its components. Examples include `uname` (print system information), `df` (report file system disk space usage), `free` (display amount of free and used memory in the system), `lscpu` (display information about the CPU architecture), and `lsblk` (list block devices).
* **Administration**: These are typically commands that alter the state of the system and are often used by system administrators. Examples include `chmod` (change file mode bits), `chown` (change file owner and group), `useradd`/`userdel` (create/delete user), `systemctl` (control the systemd system and service manager), and `apt-get` or `yum` (package handling).
