# Shell



When a user enters a command, a series of interactions occur between the user, terminal (or terminal emulator), shell, operating system (OS), and hardware to process and execute the command. Here's a step-by-step explanation of the process:

1. User input: The user types a command using an input device, typically a keyboard, in a terminal or terminal emulator window. The command is a text-based instruction that tells the computer system what action to perform.
2. Terminal/terminal emulator: The terminal or terminal emulator captures the user's input and sends the command to the shell when the user presses the 'Enter' key.
3. Shell: The shell interprets the command entered by the user. It parses the command, breaking it into its constituent parts (e.g., command name, options, arguments), and checks for syntax errors. The shell then proceeds to execute the command, which may involve running a built-in command or invoking an external program.&#x20;
4. Command execution and output: After processing the command, the hardware executes the instructions under the management of the OS. The output (if any) is sent to the terminal or terminal emulator, which displays the output to the user.
5. Command completion: Once the command has been executed and the output is displayed, the shell returns to its prompt, indicating that it is ready to receive the next command from the user.

Throughout this process, the user, terminal, shell, OS, and hardware work together to interpret, execute, and display the results of the command.





When you enter commands on the command line, you are ultimately issuing commands to the operating system. However, you are not directly communicating with the OS; rather, you interact with it through an intermediary known as the _shell_.&#x20;

The shell is a program residing between the terminal and the OS that implements the command line interface. It consists of a command interpreter and a programming language.&#x20;

As a programming language, it specifies the syntax and semantics of CLI commands—that is, the format commands must follow and what sort of operations are possible.&#x20;

As a command interpreter, it reads and interprets textual commands and executes them by invoking the appropriate calls to the operating system (OS) kernel—either directly or by calling other programs that make the calls. The OS kernel then invokes the necessary low-level hardware instructions to complete the task. If there is output for the user, it will be sent back and displayed on the terminal. The relationship between the user, terminal, shell, OS kernel, and hardware looks like the following:

The relationship between the user, terminal, shell, OS kernel, and hardware can be summarized as follows:

1. User: Interacts with the terminal by entering text-based commands.
2. Terminal: Acts as an interface to the shell, allowing the user to input text-based commands and receive output.
3. Shell: Interprets and executes commands from terminal, communicating with the OS kernel and utilities as needed.
4. OS Kernel: Receives instructions from the shell, translating them into low-level hardware operations.
5. Hardware: Executes the low-level instructions, completing the task requested by the user.
