# Shell

Just as commands issued in a programming language like Java or C must comply with a specific grammatical structure, so too must the commands entered in a terminal. Similarly, just like Java and C need to be translated via a program, so too must commands entered in a CLI.&#x20;

Enter the shell - a programming language and a command interpreter. The shell performs two critical functions:

1. **It defines the language of CLI commands**: The shell defines the syntax and semantics of CLI commands, specifying the format that commands must adhere to and the range of possible operations.
2. **It interprets CLI commands**: The shell reads and interprets textual commands entered in the terminal, executing them by running either built-in functions or by invoking external programs.



There are many types of shells. Popular ones include zsh, bash.

Each of these implements the CLI interface, those their implementation details differ. They all serve the same purpose of implementing the CLI however.&#x20;
