# Shell

When you enter commands on the command line, you are ultimately issuing commands to the operating system (OS). However, you are not directly communicating with the OS; rather, you interact with it through an intermediary known as the _shell_. The shell is a program situated between the terminal and the OS that implements the command line interface.&#x20;

The shell is both a command interpreter and a programming language. As a programming language, it defines the syntax and semantics of CLI commands, specifying the format that commands must adhere to and the range of possible operations.

As a command interpreter, the shell reads and interprets textual commands, executing them by running either a built-in function or invoking an external program, which then makes the necessary OS calls.

The sequence of interactions between the user, terminal (or terminal emulator), shell, operating system (OS), and hardware to process and execute a command can be outlined as follows:

1. **User input**: The user types a command with an input device, typically a keyboard, in a terminal or terminal emulator window. This command is a text-based instruction directing the computer system to perform a specific action.
2. **Terminal/terminal emulator**: The terminal or terminal emulator captures the user's input and transmits the command to the shell upon the user pressing the 'Enter' key.
3. **Shell**: The shell interprets the user's command, parsing it into its constituent components (e.g., command name, options, arguments), and checks for any syntax errors. The shell then proceeds to execute the command, which might involve running a built-in command or invoking an external program.
4. **Command execution and output**: After processing the command, the hardware carries out the instructions under the OS's supervision. Any resulting output is sent to the terminal or terminal emulator, which then displays it to the user.
5. **Command completion**: Once the command has been executed and the output displayed, the shell reverts to displaying its prompt, signaling that it is ready to accept the next command from the user.
