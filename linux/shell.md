# Shell

Just as commands issued in any high level programming language abide by a specific synatactixal structure, so too much commands issued in the CLI. Similarly, just as commands in programming languages are not directly executable by the computer heardware but can only interact with hardware via but must interact via various intermediaries, so too must commands issued in the shell.

The program that makes the CLI possible is called the shell, which is both a programming language and a command interpreter.

As a programming language, it defines the syntax and semantics of CLI commands, specifying the format that commands must adhere to and the range of possible operations.

As a command interpreter, it reads, interprets, and executes commands entered in the terminal.&#x20;

## How the shell executes commands

There are many types of shells. Popular ones include zsh, bash.

Each of these implements the CLI interface, those their implementation details differ. They all serve the same purpose of implementing the CLI however.
