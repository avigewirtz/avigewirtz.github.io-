# Shell

Just as commands issued in a high-level programming language utilize a specific syntactical structure, commands issued in the CLI also have their own syntax. Similarly, just as commands in programming languages are not directly executable by the computer hardware but can only interact with hardware via various intermediary software, so too with CLI commands.

The program that implements the CLI is called the shell, which is both a programming language and a command interpreter. As a programming language, it defines the syntax and semantics of CLI commands, specifying the format that commands must adhere to and the range of possible operations. As a command interpreter, it reads, interprets, and executes commands entered in the terminal.

There are various shell implementations available, each offering its own set of features and functionalities. Some popular shell implementations include Bash, Zsh, PowerShell, and Ksh, among others.

Each operating system typically has a default shell: Bash for Linux, Zsh for macOS, and PowerShell for Windows. In COS217, our focus will primarily be on the Bash shell due to its widespread usage, particularly within the Linux environment.

While Bash and Zsh have slight differences in their syntax and capabilities, they share many similarities. Thus, transitioning from Bash to Zsh (or vice versa) is relatively seamless for most users.&#x20;
