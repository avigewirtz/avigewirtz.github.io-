# Shell

CLI commands are ultimately executed by the OS. However, the commands are not issued by the user to the OS directly. Instead, they are issued via an intermediary program known as the _shell_. The shell is a program that implements the CLI.&#x20;

1. **Defining the language of CLI commands**: The shell defines the syntax and semantics of CLI commands, specifying the format that commands must adhere to and the range of possible operations.
2. **Interpreting CLI commands**: The shell reads and interprets textual commands entered in the terminal, executing them by running either built-in functions or by invoking external programs.

## Relationship Between User, Terminal. Shell, OS, and Hardware

The sequence of interactions between the user, terminal (or terminal emulator), shell, operating system (OS), and hardware to process and execute a command can be outlined as follows:

1. **User input**: The user types a command with an input device, typically a keyboard, in a terminal or terminal emulator window. This command is a text-based instruction directing the computer system to perform a specific action.
2. **Terminal/terminal emulator**: The terminal or terminal emulator captures the user's input and transmits the command to the shell upon the user pressing the 'Enter' key.&#x20;
3. **Shell**: The shell interprets the user's command, parsing it into its constituent components (e.g., command name, options, arguments), and checks for any syntax errors. The shell then proceeds to execute the command, either by running a built-in function or by invoking an external program.&#x20;
4. **Operating System**: The OS takes the commands from the shell and other programs and loads the instructions into memory for execution.&#x20;
5. **Hardware**: The hardware receives the low-level instructions from the OS and performs the necessary operations, including data processing and I/O operations. This involves the CPU, memory, storage devices, and other hardware components working together.
6. **Output and prompt**: Once the operations are completed, the output, if any, is sent back to the terminal and displayed to the user. The shell then reverts to displaying its prompt, signaling to the user that it is ready to accept another command.

The sequence of interactions is illustrated in Figure 4.
