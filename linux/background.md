# Background

Linux is an [open-source ](https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/open-source/what-is-open-source)operating system (OS) based on the Unix architecture. It was initially developed by Linus Torvalds in 1991 as a hobby project, but has since evolved into one of the most popular and widely-used OS platforms in the world.

Linux is distributed in various forms called _distributions_ or _distros_, each with its unique features, tools, and configurations. Some popular distros include Red Hat (used on armlab), Ubuntu, Fedora, and Debian.
