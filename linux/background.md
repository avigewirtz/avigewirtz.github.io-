# Background

Linux is an [open-source ](https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/open-source/what-is-open-source)operating system (OS) based on the Unix architecture. It was initially developed by Linus Torvalds in 1991 as a hobby project, but has since evolved into one of the most popular and widely-used OS platforms in the world.

Linux is distributed in various forms called _distributions_ or _distros_, each with its unique features, tools, and configurations. Some popular distros include Red Hat (used on Armlab), Ubuntu, Fedora, and Debian.

In this section, we will cover the basics of the Linux OS and its associated utilities.&#x20;

<summary>Aside: What even is Unix?</summary>

The term "Unix" was originally used to refer to a specific operating system developed in the late 1960s and early 1970s by Ken Thompson, Dennis Ritchie, and others at AT\&T's Bell Labs.&#x20;

As Unix grew in popularity, AT\&T began to license the Unix OS source code to academic institutions and commercial entities. This broadened the meaning of the term "Unix" as it was no longer confined to the original system developed at Bell Labs.&#x20;

Later, a number of clones emerged. These were operating systems designed to mimic the functionality of the Unix system, without necessarily using its original source code. One notable example of such a clone is Linux.
