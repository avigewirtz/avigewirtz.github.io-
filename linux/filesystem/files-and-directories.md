# Files and Directories

### Files

At the most basic level, a Linux file is simply a sequence of bytes. When these bytes are structured in a meaningful way, they are interpretable by programs and able to be rendered by them as text, photos, videos, music, executable programs (such as your computer’s own operating system), and so on. A file is the smallest unit of computer storage; everything in storage–however small–is contained in a file.&#x20;

In general, each program imposes its own set of formatting rules that files must conform to in order to be executed by them. For example, Microsoft Word will not open a file unless its internal structure meets a format recognized by it, such as doc. Similarly, Linux will not execute a file unless it is formatted with specific sections. (You will learn about this later in COS217.) In general, encoding schemes and formatting rules transform files from meaningless sequences of bytes into comprehensible units of information. &#x20;

### Directory

A directory is simply a special type of file—one that contains references to other files (and directories). Grouping related files into directories keeps the filesystem organized, making it easier to locate files.&#x20;
