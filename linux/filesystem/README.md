# Filesystem

A fundamental feature of an operating system is the filesystem, which consists of two main components: (1) a collection of files, and (2) a directory structure that organizes these files. Before delving into the details of the Linux filesystem, it's helpful to first provide an overview of Linux files and directories..

The term "Linux filesystem" is a bit of a misnomer, as Linux does not have any official filesystems or even an official filesystem standard. Rather, the term refers to a variety of filesystems that are supported by the Linux kernel and share a common set of features inherited from Unix.&#x20;

Of the many Linux-supported filesystems, some of these filesystems were specifically designed for Linux, while others were initially created for different operating systems but have since been adapted to work with Linux. This flexibility allows users to choose the filesystem that best suits their needs and preferences.

Some of the commonly used filesystems supported by Linux include Ext4 (used by armlab), XFS, Btrfs, FAT32, and NTFS.&#x20;
