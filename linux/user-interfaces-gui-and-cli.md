# User Interfaces: GUI and CLI

A user interface defines the mechanism through which a user issues commands to a computer. Throughout computer history, there have been various types of user interfaces. The primary types of user interfaces are _graphical user interfaces (GUIs)_ and _command-line interfaces (CLIs)_.

### Graphical User Interface

The GUI is the default interface on macOS and Windows. GUIs are visually intuitive and user-friendly, allowing users to issue commands by clicking on graphical elements such as windows, icons, and menus. They are especially beneficial for users who are less familiar with the technical aspects of computer systems. Common GUI elements include:

* **Windows**: Rectangular areas that display content or applications
* **Icons**: Small images representing files, folders, or applications
* **Menus**: Lists of options or commands that can be selected by the user
* **Buttons**: Graphical elements that perform specific actions when clicked

### Command Line Interface

The CLI is a method of interacting with your computer where you issue commands via text rather than clicking or dragging graphical elements like buttons, icons, or menus. Examples of CLI usage include:

1. Opening an application: If a user wants to open an application such as Microsoft Word, they must issue a textual command like `open -a "Microsoft Word"` rather than double-clicking the Microsoft Word icon.
2. Moving a file: If a user wants to move a file from one folder to another, they must issue a textual command like `mv source_file destination_directory` rather than using the drag-and-drop paradigm.&#x20;

Both GUIs and CLIs have their advantages and limitations. GUIs are more intuitive and user-friendly, making them suitable for less technical users or for tasks that involve a lot of visual elements. On the other hand, CLIs offer more flexibility and control, making them the preferred choice for advanced users or for tasks that involve automation or repetitive actions. The choice between them depends on the user's level of expertise, personal preferences, and the specific task at hand.\
