# Command Line User Interface

One of the primary features of the OS is that it provides a (relatively) clean interface to the computer hardware, enabling users to more efficiently interact with the computer. All commands are ultimately issued to the OS for execution. There are two primary types of interfaces we can use to issue commands. The _graphical user interfaces (GUIs)_ and _command-line interfaces (CLIs)_.

### Graphical User Interface

The GUI is the default interface on macOS and Windows. In a GUI, users issue commands by clicking on graphical elements such as windows, icons, and menus. Common GUI elements include:

* **Windows**: Rectangular areas that display content or applications.
* **Icons**: Small images representing files, folders, or applications.
* **Menus**: Lists of options or commands that can be selected by the user.
* **Buttons**: Graphical elements that perform specific actions when clicked.

The GUI provides a visually intuitive and user-friendly interface, making it especially beneficial for less technical computer users.

### Command Line Interface

The Command Line Interface (CLI) is a text-based interface where users issue commands by typing sequences of text instead of clicking on graphical elements. To better visualize a CLI, think of it as interacting with a computer through a text messaging interface. The CLI is capable of performing all the commands that a Graphical User Interface (GUI) can do and even more. The only difference lies in how the commands are issued.

Let's consider a couple of examples to highlight the distinction:

1. Opening an application, such as Microsoft Word:
   * GUI: Users can simply double-click on the Microsoft Word icon.
   * CLI: Users need to enter a textual command like `open -a "Microsoft Word"`.
2. Moving a file:
   * GUI: Users can move a file using the _drag-and-drop_ paradigm.
   * CLI: Users must issue a textual command like `mv source_file destination_directory`.

Both GUIs and CLIs have their advantages and limitations. GUIs are more intuitive and user-friendly, making them suitable for less technical users or for tasks that involve a lot of visual elements. On the other hand, CLIs offer more flexibility and control, making them the preferred choice for advanced users or for tasks that involve automation or repetitive actions. The choice between them depends on the user's level of expertise, personal preferences, and the specific task at hand.
