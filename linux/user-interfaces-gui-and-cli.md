# User Interfaces: GUI and CLI

A user interface defines the mechanism through which a user issues commands to a computer. Throughout computer history, there have been various types of user interfaces. Today, the most common interface is the **Graphical User Interface** (GUI). The primary types of user interfaces are **graphical user interfaces (GUIs)** and **command-line interfaces (CLIs)**.

### Graphical User Interface

The **graphical user interface (GUI)** is the default interface on macOS and Windows. GUIs are visually intuitive and user-friendly, allowing users to issue commands by clicking on graphical elements such as windows, icons, and menus. They are especially beneficial for users who are less familiar with the technical aspects of computer systems. Common GUI elements include:

* **Windows**: Rectangular areas that display content or applications
* **Icons**: Small images representing files, folders, or applications
* **Menus**: Lists of options or commands that can be selected by the user
* **Buttons**: Graphical elements that perform specific actions when clicked

### Command Line Interface

The CLI is a textual interface—that is, it has no mouse to point with or icons to drag-and-drop. Rather, all commands are in the form of sequences of text, normally typed by the user on the keyboard and issued by pressing ENTER. For example, if a user wants to open an application such as a web browser, they don’t have the luxury of opening it by double-clicking a browser icon—instead, they must issue a textual command. Similarly, if a user wants to move a file from one folder to another, they don’t have the drag-and-drop option—instead, they too must issue a textual command.&#x20;

Both GUIs and CLIs have their advantages and limitations. The choice between them depends on the user's level of expertise, personal preferences, and the specific task at hand.\
