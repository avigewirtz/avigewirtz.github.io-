# User Interfaces: GUI and CLI

A user interface defines the mechanism through which a user issues commands to a computer. A command is a directive to a computer to perform a specific task. Throughout computer history, there have been various types of user interfaces. Today, the most common interface is the **Graphical User Interface** (GUI). There is another less familiar but more powerful interface--namely, the **Command Line Interface** (CLI).

### Graphical User Interface

The GUI is the default interface on macOS and Windows computers. It contains icons, windows, and menus, which are manipulated using the point-and-click or swipe-and-tap paradigm. The intuitive nature and smooth learning curve of the GUI makes it the natural choice for most users. In fact, many users aren't even aware of the existence of an alternative, more powerful interface—namely, the **Command Line Interface** (CLI).&#x20;

### Command Line Interface

The CLI is a textual interface—that is, it has no mouse to point with or icons to drag-and-drop. Rather, all commands are in the form of sequences of text, normally typed by the user on the keyboard and issued by pressing ENTER. For example, if a user wants to open an application such as a web browser, they don’t have the luxury of opening it by double-clicking a browser icon—instead, they must issue a textual command. Similarly, if a user wants to move a file from one folder to another, they don’t have the drag-and-drop option—instead, they too must issue a textual command.&#x20;
