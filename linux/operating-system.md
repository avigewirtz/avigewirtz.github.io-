# Operating System

Whether commands are issued by the user via a GUI or a CLI, they are ultimately being issued to the Operating System (OS). The OS is perhaps the most important software that runs on a computer or device. It acts like the "boss" of the computer, managing and coordinating all its activities.

Think of the operating system as a bridge between the computer's hardware (such as the processor, memory, and I/O devices) and the software applications (like web browsers, games, and word processors) that you use. It ensures that these applications can communicate with the hardware and utilize its resources effectively.

The operating system performs several key tasks. It controls how programs are executed, manages the computer's memory to ensure that different programs don't interfere with each other, and handles input and output operations (like displaying information on the screen or printing documents).

Different operating systems exist, such as Windows, macOS, and Linux. Each has its own features and design, but they all serve the same purpose of making the computer usable and providing a platform for running applications.
