# Terminal

CLI commands are issued via a _terminal_. In the nascent days of interactive computing, terminals were hardware devices, consisting of a keyboard for entering commands and a display unit for printing output. The first terminals were teletype machines, such as the Model 33 ASR shown in Figure 1, whose display unit was a paper-roll printer.

Teletypes fell out of use in the 1970s with the widespread adoption of video display terminals, such as the DEC VT100 shown in Figure 2. These terminals employed screens to display output instead of paper-roll printers, making the CLI more efficient and user-friendly.

Today, hardware terminals have become obsolete. Instead, the CLI is accessed via _terminal emulators_, which are programs integrated into GUIs that simulate the functionality of their hardware predecessors. An example of a terminal emulator is macOS's Terminal shown in Figure 3.&#x20;
