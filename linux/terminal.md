# Terminal

The CLI is accessed via a terminal. In the early days of interactive computing, terminals were hardware devices consisting of a keyboard and display unit. The first terminals were teletype machines, such as the Model 33 ASR shown in Figure 1, whose display unit was a paper-roll printer.

Teletypes fell out of use in the 1970s with the widespread adoption of video display terminals, such as the DEC VT100 shown in Figure 2. These terminals, unlike teletypes, used screens as their output device. &#x20;

Nowadays, no one uses hardware terminals anymore. Instead, we access the CLI via a GUI program called a terminal emulator, such as macOSâ€™s Terminal application shown in Figure 3, which mimics the functionality of a hardware terminal.&#x20;
