# Introduction

At its core, make is a build automation tool that simplifies the process of building multi-file programs. It uses a file known as a Makefile, which contains a set of directives for compiling the software. These directives include rules, dependencies, and actions that define how to compile and link the program.

## Motivation for make



## Incremental builds



Recall from chapter 4 that the GCC build process involves four stages: preprocessing, compilation proper, assembly, and linking. Let's examine how that works with testintmath.&#x20;



















Why do we need make to handle the build process for us? Well, there are two approaches to rebuilding multi-file programs without make. The first is easy but inefficient for large programs. The second is efficient but tedious and error-prone. Let's examine both methods using the testintmath program from precept four, shown in Figure 1.&#x20;

## Approach 1: Full builds

The simplest approach to building testintmath is to invoke the following gcc command, whether you're building it for the first time or the tenth time:

```
gcc intmath.c testintmath.c -o testintmath
```

\<explain why although such an appraoch works fine for a small program for testintmath, it is inefficient as programs grow large>&#x20;

## Approach 2: Manual Incremental builds

\<explain this approach>

using this approach, we of course still have to do a full build the first time we build testintmath. However, rather than invoking:

```
gcc intmath.c testintmath.c -o testintmath
```

Which does a full build but does not retian intermediate object files, we build testintmath in two steps. First , we invoke gcc with the -c option, which generates object files for intmath.c and testintmath.c:

```
gcc -c intmath.c testintmath.c
```

Then, we invoke gcc on the&#x20;

Because we now have object files, subsequent builds can be incremental. Let's illustrate how this works.&#x20;











## Building testintmath: Brute-force appraoch





Unfortunately, it is very easy for a programmer to forget which les depend on which others, which les have been modi ed recently, and the exact sequence of operations needed to make or exercise a new version of the program















The strategy is simple. First, we build our program as usual, but we ensure testintmath, we ensure to save the intermediate object files. To build testintmath, we'll use a two-step approach. First, we invoke gcc with the -c flag on each .c file:

```
gcc -c intmath.c 
gcc -c testintmath.c
```

This preprocesses, compiles, and assembles intmath.c and testintmath.c, generating the object files intmath.o and testintmath.o. Note that in the preprocessing stage of both intmath.c and testintmath.c, the contents of intmath.h are included into them. &#x20;

rather than using the familiar command, `gcc intmath.c testintmath.c -o testintmath`--which would generate the testintmath executable but would not retain the intermediate object files--we'll use the approach shown in Figure 2. In this approach, we first invoke gcc on each .c file with the -c option:

```bash
gcc -c intmath.c testintmath.c
```

This preprocesses, compiles, and assembles intmath.c and testintmath.c, producing the object files intmath.o and testintmath.o. Note that in the preprocessing stage of both intmath.c and testintmath.c, the contents are intmath.h were inserted into each.  Thus, `intmath.o` is derived from both `intmath.c` and `intmath.h`. Similarly, testintmath.o is derived from both `intmath.c` and `intmath.h`.



We then link intmath.o and testintmath.o, generating the testintmath executable:&#x20;

```
gcc intmath.c testintmath.c -o testintmath
```

### Rebuilding testintmath

Now imagine we make a change to one of our source files. Our goal is to rebuild testintmath by recompiling the minimum necessary source files. An easy way to figure our what changes require which files to be rebuilt is via a dependency graph.&#x20;











&#x20; recompile the mininum  To rebuild testintmath, we need only recompile intmath.c

\<over here i want to explain how if we make changes we can use partial builds to rebuild testintmath. i want to explain using a dependency graph of testintmath, where each node represents a file, and directed edges (arrows) between these nodes indicate a dependency, where an edge from file A to file B signifies that B is dependent on A. In other words, a change in file A requires file B to be updated.>

our objective is to generate a new executable by recompiling the minimum necessary files. To do this accurately, we need to have a thorough understanding of the program's dependencies, which can be visualized using a dependency graph.

In such a graph, each node represents a file, and directed edges (arrows) between these nodes indicate a dependency, where an edge from file A to file B signifies that B is dependent on A. In other words, a change in file A requires file B to be updated. A dependency graph for testintmath is shown in Figure 2.&#x20;
