# Motivation for Make

## Introduction

Imagine you're working on a C program consisting of 1000 source files, and you make a change to just one .c file. To incorporate the change, you'd need to rebuild the executable. Having to recompile all 1000 source files due to a change in just one would be extremely time-consuming and a drain on system resources.  Thankfully, there's no need to go down that route. Long ago, an elegant solution called _separate compilation_ was developed. In this scheme, rather than compiling a multi-file program as a monolithic unit, each source file is compiled independently into an object file and then linked together to form the final executable. This process is shown in Figure 1. The benefit of this approach is that you can retain the object files for future use, thus not having to rebuild object files that would be unaffected by changes.&#x20;

At first glance, implementing this strategy might seem straightforward. Before rebuilding an executable, you compare the timestamps of all source files with the timestamps of the executable, and if a source file is newer than the executable, you recompile just those source files. Unfortunately, the process is far more complex. In addition to keeping track of which files changed, you also have to keep track of dependencies.&#x20;

It is precisely these frustrations that led Stuart Feldman to create the make program in 1978. In a nutshell, make is a program that automates this process...&#x20;

Once you set up an appropriate makefile, you build your program by simple invoking:

```
make
```

and make figures out for you the minimum required number of files that have to be recompiled, and invokes the necessary commands.&#x20;

In this chapter, we will go over the basics of how make works and setting up a makefile. To set the stage, we will first go over the manual approach. Then we'll go over how to do it using make.&#x20;



## Separate compilation: Manual Approach

As a running example throughout this chapter, we'll use the testintmath program from precept 4, shown in Figure 1.&#x20;

### Building testintmath

To build testintmath, rather than using the familiar command, `gcc intmath.c testintmath.c -o testintmath`--which does not retain the intermediate object files--we will build our program using the following commands:&#x20;

```bash
gcc -c intmath.c testintmath.c  
gcc intmath.o testintmath.o -o testintmath
```

The first command compiles intmath.c and testintmath.c into object files--intmath.o and testintmath.o respectievly. The second command links intmath.o and testintmath.o--along with standard library functions like `printf` and `scanf`--to generate the executable testintmath.

### Rebuilding testintmath

If we are to make changes to our program, our objective is to generate a new executable by recompiling the minimum necessary files. To do this accurately, we need to have a thorough understanding of the program's dependencies, which can be visualized using a dependency graph.

In such a graph, each node represents a file, and directed edges (arrows) between these nodes indicate a dependency, where an edge from file A to file B signifies that B is dependent on A. In other words, a change in file A requires file B to be updated. A dependency graph for testintmath is shown in Figure 2.&#x20;
