# How make Processes a Makefile

`make` processes a Makefile via a [depth first search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depth-first\_search) (DFS) traversal of its dependency graph, starting from the default target or from the target specified on the command line. For each target, `make` recursively examines its dependencies, diving deeper until it reaches a leaf node (a file without any dependencies). When it hits a leaf node, `make` backtracks to the previous target and checks any remaining dependencies.

During backtracking, it executes the command to build each target if either the target does not exist or if one of its deoendencies has a more recent modification timestamp. 

This DFS traversal ensures that all of a target's dependencies exist and are up to date before building it.

If an error occurs during the execution of any command, `make` typically stops the build process and reports the error, although this behavior can be modified with flags such as `-k` to continue despite errors. 

Let's now examine this DFS traversal at various points in development. 

#### Case 1: Running our makefile when all the targets don't exist

Suppose we're building `testintmath` for the first time. In this case, neither `testintmath` nor `testintmath.o` and `intmath.o` exist yet. Here's how `make` would process the Makefile if we were to run `make`:

* It starts off by examines the first target, `testintmath`. `make` notes that it does not exist. It might seem that make should immediately invoke the command to build `testintmath` (i.e., `gcc217 testintmath.o intmath.o -o testintmath`) , but make must first ensure that `testintmath`'s dependencies (i.e., `intmath.o`, `testintmath.o`) are up to date. In our case, they don't even exist yet.
  * `make` moves on to `testintmath.o`. It notes that `testintmath.o` does not exist.
    * `make` examines `testintmath.c`. It notes that it exists and is a leaf--meaning, it has no dependencies. Thus, it has no work to do for `testintmath.c`. `make` then backtracks to `testintmath.o`.
    * `make` examines `intmath.h`. It notes that it exists and is a leaf. `make` then backtracks again to `testintmath.o`.
  * Having determined that `testintmath.o`'s dependencies exist and are up to date, `make` now builds `testintmath.o` by invoking: `gcc217 -c testintmath.c`. It then backtracks to `testintmath`.
  * `make` now examines testintmath's other dependency--intmath.o. It notes that it does not exist.
    * `make` then examines intmath.c. It notes that it exists and is a leaf.
    * `make` sees that intmath.o's other dependency is intmath.h. It avoids a redundant check and instead goes back up to intmath.o
  * `make` now builds `intmath.o` by invoking: `gcc217 -c intmath.c`. It then goes back up to `testintmath`.
* Finally, `make` builds `testintmath` by invoking: `gcc217 testintmath.o intmath.o -o testintmath`.

The DFS traversal is summarized in Figure 2.4.

#### Case 2: Running our makefile when all targets are up to date

Suppose we invoke `make` immediately after building `testintmath`. make will respond by notifying us that `testintmath` is up to date, and hence it will not execute any commands:

```bash
$ make
make: `testintmath' is up to date.
$
```

The DFS traversal is summarized in Figure 2.5.

#### Case 3: Running our makefile after a source file is modified

Suppose we invoke `make` after `intmath.c` is modified, but all the other files remain untouched. Make will execute the commands to build `intmath.o` and `testintmath`, but it will not execute the command to build `testintmath.o`:

```bash
$ make
gcc -c intmath.c
gcc testintmath.o intmath.o -o testintmath
$
```

The DFS traversal is summarized in Figure 2.6.
