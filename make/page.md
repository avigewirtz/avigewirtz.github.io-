Imagine you’re working on a C program consisting of 1000 source files and you make a change to just one file. You wouldn't want to recompile all 1000 files for this single change to take effect, as it would be extremely time-consuming. Instead, you’d want to recompile only the file you've updated. Thankfully, GCC (and other C compilers) enable you to do just that.&#x20;
