# Armlab

Armlab is a Linux-based computer cluster maintained by Princeton's Computer Science department. The cluster consists of two interconnected computersâ€”armlab01 and armlab02.

As a student in COS217, you are assigned a user account on Armlab, which you'll use to develop and submit your C and assembly programs. The purpose of Armlab in CO217 is to ensure a standardized computing environment for all students in the course.

To access Armlab, you must first activate your account. Once you have done so, you will be able to log into Armlab from your PC by establishing an SSH comnection. The instructions for activating your account and logging in are provided in this chapter. While you work on Armlab, Linux provides the illusion that you're the only user on the system. In reality, however, many users may be logged in concurrently (Figure 1). Armlab runs on something of the order of 96 CPUs, so it has no problem handling a high workload.
