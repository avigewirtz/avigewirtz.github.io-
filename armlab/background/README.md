# What is Armlab?

In COS217, armlab will serve as your primary platform for developing and executing your C and assembly programs. Armlab is a Linux-based computer cluster maintained by Princeton's Computer Science department. The cluster consists of two interconnected computersâ€”armlab01 and armlab02.

You can think of Armlab as a computer just like your own, but with a few notable differences:

1. Armlab is accessed remotely, rather than physically. Specifically, you log into Armlab from your personal computer by establishing an [SSH](logging-into-armlab/ssh-protocol.md) connection over a network.
2. Armlab is a multiuser computer utilized by many Princeton students and faculty, often concurrently.
3. Armlab runs on Linux, while your PC almost certainly runs on Windows or macOS.

Figure 1 shows multiple users logged into Armlab concurrently.
