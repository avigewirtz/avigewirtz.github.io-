# Committing Staged Files

Committing files in Git means creating a snapshot of the changes you've staged and recording them in the repository's history. This allows you to keep track of your work progress, collaborate with others, and revert to previous versions if needed. The general form of a Git commit command is as follows:

| git commit -m commit\_message |
| ----------------------------- |

Where commit\_message is replaced with a concise, meaningful description of the changes you made. This message helps you and your collaborators understand the purpose of the commit when reviewing the project's history.

There is no hard set rule on when to commit changes. Instead, it is totally a matter of personal preference. It is usually done when there is a material update to your project, such as a bug fix.&#x20;

Common options:&#x20;

\--amend — This option replaces the last commit with a new one, which can be useful for fixing minor errors or typos or changing the commit message.

Usage:

| git commit --amend -m "New commit message" |
| ------------------------------------------ |

\-a — This option automatically stages any tracked files that have been modified or deleted before committing. It does not stage new (untracked) files. This option helps to skip the separate git add step for modified files.

Usage:

| git commit -a -m "Your commit message here" |
| ------------------------------------------- |
