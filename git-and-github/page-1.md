# Cloning a Git Repository

\
Cloning a Git repository means making a copy of an existing repository. Unlike a new repository, a cloned repository comes with all project files, history, and other metadata from the source repository. Some information, however—such as configuration settings— is not propagated from to the cloned repository. &#x20;

\


A repository can be cloned from anywhere, be it from the same computer or a from one connected over a network. In practice, however, repositories are generally cloned from popular hosting platforms like GitHub, Gitlab, and Bitbucket.&#x20;

\


To clone a Git repository, follow these steps:

\
Assuming you’re cloning a repository from Github, you’re URL will look like the following: &#x20;

```bash
https://github.com/GITHUB_USERNAME/REPOSITORY_NAME.git
```

\


Replace the URL with the one you copied from the remote repository. This command will create the directory repository\_name in the current working directory.
