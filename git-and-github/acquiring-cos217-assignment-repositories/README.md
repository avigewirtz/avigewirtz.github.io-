# Acquiring COS217 Assignment Repositories

Now that we’ve discussed the basics of how Git and GitHub work, let’s delve into the specifics of obtaining COS217 assignment repositories. While this step may seem straightforward, it is somewhat complicated by the fact that in COS217, you will want to maintain two copies of each COS217 assignment repository–one copy on your (or your partner’s) GitHub account, and one copy on your development computer, and you will want the repository on your development computer to be linked to your repository on GitHub.&#x20;

The copy on your development computer will serve as your working copy, while the copy on GitHub will serve as the repository you synchronize your work with. For single assignments, the benefit is your code will be stored permanently on the cloud. For partnered assignments, this will enable you to easily sync up your code with your partner's.&#x20;

There are several methods we can use to obtain these two copies. For reasons that will be explained later, some methods are more complicated than others. For the purposes of this tutorial, we will go through two methods. The first method is simpler, though it is GitHub-specific, while the second method is more complex, though it can all be accomplished via git commands.
