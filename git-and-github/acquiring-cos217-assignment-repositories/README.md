# Obtaining COS217 Assignment Repositories

Now that we’ve discussed the basics of how Git works, let’s delve into the specifics of obtaining COS217 assignment repositories. All assignment repositories are hosted on the COS217 GitHub account. In COS217, you will want to maintain two copies of each COS217 assignment repository. One copy on your (or your partner’s) GitHub account, and one copy on your development computer. Further, you will want your development repository to be linked to your repository on GitHub.&#x20;

While the process for obtaining two copies is seemingly straightforward, it is somewhat complicated by the fact that by default, Git links a clone to its source. Thus, if you clone the official COS217 repository to your development computer, the clone will be linked to the COS217 repository. This is not what you want, however. You want the clone to be linked to your personal GitHub copy.&#x20;

There are numerous ways you can get around this. We will now cover two methods. The first method is much simpler, but it uses the GitHub Import Tool, which is not native to Git.  The second method is more complex, but it uses native Git commands. &#x20;
