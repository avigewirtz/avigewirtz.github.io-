# Important Git commands

The Git status command provides information about the current state of your working directory, such as which files have been added or modified but not staged, which files have been staged but not committed, and which branch you're currently working on. It is an extremely useful command, as it helps you understand the current state of your repository.

The basic syntax of git status is as follows:

| git status |
| ---------- |

Git status will output several pieces of information, including:&#x20;

* The branch you're currently working on. If you have any unpushed commits, it will also indicate how many commits ahead your local branch is compared to the remote branch.
* Changes to be committed. That is, new or modified files that have been staged but not yet committed.&#x20;
* Changes not staged for commit. That is, tracked files that have not been added to the staging areaâ€“i.e., files that will not be in the next commit (unless they are staged using git add.&#x20;
* Untracked files. That is, new files that have never been added to the Git repository.

Using git status frequently is a good practice, as it helps you understand the current state of your repository, ensuring that you're aware of any changes before committing or switching branches.
