# Getting Help

If you ever need assistance with a Git command, you can use the Git help command to obtain a comprehensive manual page (manpage). Simply invoke `git help` with the name of the Git command you want. For example, if you want to access the manpage for the `add` command:

```bash
git help add
```

If you don't need an extensive manpage but instead are looking for a brief overview of the available options for a Git command, you can use the -h option, as so:

```bash
git add -h
```
