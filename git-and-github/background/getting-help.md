# Getting Help

If you need assistance with a Git command, you can use the `git help` command to obtain a comprehensive manual page (_manpage_). For example, to obtain the _manpage_ for the `add` command, invoke:

```bash
git help add
```

If you don't need an extensive _manpage_ but instead are looking for a brief overview of the available options for a Git command, you can use the `-h` option, as so:

```bash
git add -h
```
