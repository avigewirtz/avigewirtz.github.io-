# Authentication

When you clone a Git repository, you will sometimes need to provide credentials to prove that you are authorized to access the repository. In the previous example (ai.e., when we cloned _survey_ from GitHub), we did not need authentication credentials, since the repository was _public--_meaning it can be viewed and cloned by anyone.

It goes without saying that when you upload a repository to GitHub, you don't necessarily want to make visible to the world. As such, Github provides you the option of classifying your repository as _private_. Private repositories are only visible to their owner(s) and explicitly invited collaborators. Thus, when attempting to clone a private repository, you need to first authenticate yourself. You do so by providing the GitHub username and password of an authorized account. However, instead of using the regular login password, you will need to use a [Personal Access Token](../../appendices/git-installation.md#generating-a-github-personal-access-token), which provides enhanced security measures
