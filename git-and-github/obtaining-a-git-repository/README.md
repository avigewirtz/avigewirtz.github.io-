# Obtaining a Git Repository

There are two ways you can acquire a Git repository:

1. You can create a new Git repository.
2. You can clone (copy) an existing Git repository.

Creating a repository entails initializing a Git repository for a project that is not currently under Git version control. Cloning a Git repository, on the other hand, entails duplicating an existing repository; as such, it comes populated with the source repository's files, history, and other metadata.

We will now cover the basics of creating and cloning Git repositories. The instructions below are intended to merely get you started with Git commands; they are not intended to be a comprehensive overview.&#x20;
