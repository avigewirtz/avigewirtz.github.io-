# Initializing a Git Repository

Creating a Git repository means initializing a new repository for a project not currently under Git version control. The process of creating a Git repository is extremely simple. You simply navigate (using the cd command) to the directory containing the files you wish to version control and invoke git init. This will create a hidden .git subdirectory that contains all the information needed to version-control your project. &#x20;

Note that creating a Git repository (i.e., invoking git init) does not in itself cause all the files in that directory to be saved to the Git repository. As weâ€™ll discuss later, you must manually add each file you want git to track to the repository.
