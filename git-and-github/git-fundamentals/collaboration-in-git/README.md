# Collaboration in Git

Software development is a collaborative process, often involving multiple team members working together on a software product. In this environment, it is essential for team members to effectively coordinate their efforts and keep track of changes made to the project. One common collaborative workflow is the centralized workflow, which relies on a single, central repository hosted on a server that all team members have access to.

In a centralized workflow, each team member downloads a copy of the project from the central repository, makes changes to it, and then synchronizes their copy with the central version. This ensures that everyone is working with the most up-to-date version of the project and minimizes conflicts between different members' work.

Git supports this collaborative workflow by enabling repositories to be copied. This process is called cloning. Cloning is the first step in setting up a local copy of a repository for a team member to work on. However, cloning alone is not enough for effective collaboration.

Git also enables repositories to exchange data with each other through push and pull operations. When a team member has made changes to their local copy of the repository and wants to share them with the team, they can use the 'push' operation to send their changes to the central repository. Other team members can then use the 'pull' operation to update their local copies with the latest changes from the central repository.







Software development is a highly collaborative environment, with developers often working together on a shared codebase.



One way code can be shared is by cloning repositories.&#x20;

The Git clone command is only the first step in sharing code. Git also has commands that enable developers may subsequently wish to synchronize their cloned repository with its source. Or they may simply wish to exchange data between any two arbitrary repositories.&#x20;

\


For these purposes, Git supports push and pull operations between repositories. A push operation is one in which data is uploaded to a remote repository. A pull operation is one where data is downloaded from a remote repository.&#x20;

\
\


In the context of data exchange, the repository your are working in—that is, issuing the Git commands—is considered the local repository, while the repository you are exchanging data with is considered the remote repository.&#x20;

\


Just like with the Git clone operation, a pull or push operation requires a URL. This tells Git where to locate the repository. A push or pull command might look like the following: &#x20;

\


git pull remote\_repo\_URL

git push remote\_repo\_URL

\


In other words, Git is provided the URL of the remote repository it will be pulling from or pushing to.&#x20;

\


The centralized workflow is a collaboration model in which there is a central repository, typically hosted on a server like GitHub, that all developers have access to, as shown in Figure X. This repository contains the main codebase that serves as the authoritative version of the project; as such, it is the repository that all team members synchronize their code with.&#x20;

A highly simplified workflow sequence using  this collaboration model might look like the following:

\


1. Each developer clones the shared repository to their development computer. They will use the copy to develop with.&#x20;
2. When a developer is ready to share their changes, they upload, or push, their changes to the central repository. This makes the changes visible to other team members and allows them to review, test, and provide feedback. Note that at this step the changes are not yet merged into the main codebase.&#x20;
3. If the changes are approved, they are merged into the main codebase. This step may involve resolving any merge conflicts that arise due to concurrent changes made by other developers. We will discuss merge conflicts later and how to resolve them.&#x20;
4. After the All team members download, or pull, the updated changes to their local repositories. From here steps 2-4 are repeated.
