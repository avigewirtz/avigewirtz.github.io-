# Authentication

Whether or not you need to authenticate yourself before accessing a remote repository depends on several factors, such as the transfer protocol used by the remote repository and whether you want to upload or download data.&#x20;

We will focus on remote repositories hosted on GitHub that are accessed via the HTTP protocol.&#x20;

There are two types of repositories on GitHub: public and private. Public repositories can be viewed by anyone, whereas private repositories are only visible to their owners (or maintainers) and explicitly invited collaborators.&#x20;

With regard to uploading to GitHub repositories, only authorized individuals may upload to repositories, regardless of whether the repository is public or private.&#x20;

With regard to downloading from repositories, anyone may download from a public repository, but only authorized individuals may download from a private one.&#x20;

To authenticate yourself when accessing GitHub from the command line, you must provide your username and Personal Access Token (PAS).\
