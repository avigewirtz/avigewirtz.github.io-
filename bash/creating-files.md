# Creating Files

There are numerous ways you can create files on the command line. You can use the `touch` command, which creates empty files, or you can use a text editor like emacs, which you can use to immediately edit the file. The choice between using `touch` and a text editor depends on your needs. If you need to create an empty file quickly, `touch` is a good choice. If you need to create a file and immediately edit it, using a text editor is a better choice. In the following exercises, we will demonstrate creating files with the `touch` command, since it is simpler. The syntax for `touch` is as follows: <mark style="color:red;">**`touch`**</mark><mark style="color:blue;">**`FILE_NAME(s)`**</mark><mark style="color:blue;">.</mark>&#x20;

The <mark style="color:blue;">**FILE\_NAME(s)**</mark> parameter represents the name or names of the files you want to create or update. You can specify multiple file names, each separated by spaces.
