# Navigating the filesystem

To effectively navigate the Linux filesystem, you need be familiar with three commands: _pwd_, _ls_, and _cd,_ all of which we'll cover in this section. These are perhaps the most commonly used Bash commands, so it is worth your while to make the extra effort to master them.

Before studying this section, ensure you are comfortable with the idea of [pathnames](../../linux-operating-system/filesystem/pathnames.md), which is covered in section (fill in later).&#x20;
