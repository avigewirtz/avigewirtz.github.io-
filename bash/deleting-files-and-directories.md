# Deleting Files and Directories

Deleting files and directories can be accomplished with the `rm` command. Its syntax is as follows: <mark style="color:red;">**`rm`**</mark><mark style="color:green;">**`OPTION(S)`**</mark><mark style="color:blue;">**`FILES/DIRECTORY(IES)`**</mark>.&#x20;

The <mark style="color:blue;">**FILES/DIRECTORY(IES)**</mark> parameter represents the files or directories you want to delete. By default, the `rm` command only deletes files. To use it to delete directories, you must supply the `-r` option (i.e., `rm -r DIRECTORY(IES)`.&#x20;

While both empty and nonempty files and directories can be deleted with the `rm` command, you can also use the `rmdir` command to delete empty directories. The benefit of using the `rmdir` command to delete directories is it provides a more explicit and cautious approach to deleting directories. By restricting itself to empty directories, it helps prevent accidental deletion of nonempty directories and their contents.

### Common options

* **`-r`**: Deletes directory(ies), even if they are not empty.
* **`-i`**: Prompts the user for confirmation before deleting each file/directory.&#x20;
* **`-f`**: Overrides `-i` option (i.e., removes confirmation prompt).

{% hint style="danger" %}
Deleting files and directories is a dangerous operation. If youâ€™re not careful, the operating system will do exactly what you tell it to, including destroying every last one of your files and directories. For this reason, deleting non-empty files or non-empty directories is deliberately made difficult.&#x20;

### Exercises

1. Delete _dir1_ using `rmdir`:

The operation succeeds since _dir1_ is empty.

2. Delete _dir2_ using `rmdir`:

The operation fails since _dir2_ is not empty.&#x20;

3. Let's clean things up a bit. Delete _dir3_, _dir4_, _bad_, _name_, and '_bad name_':

4. Delete _file1_:

The prompt `rm: remove regular empty file 'file1'?`  is displayed because on Armlab, `rm` is aliased to `rm -i`.&#x20;

2. Delete _dir2_:

3. Delete _file3_ and _file4_ using the `-f` option, which removes the confirmation prompt:
