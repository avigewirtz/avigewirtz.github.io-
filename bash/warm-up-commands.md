# Warm Up Commands

We'll begin our command line journey by exploring some simple Bash commands on Armlab. First, [log in](../armlab/background/logging-into-armlab.md) to Armlab. After logging in, you'll see a _shell prompt_ displayed on your terminal window that looks like the following:

### Shell prompt

The prompt is generated by Bash, indicating its readiness to accept a command. It also provides useful information, such as the hostname of the computer you are logged into (armlab01 or armlab02), the working directory you are currently in (by default your home directory, which is represented by \~), and your access level ($ for ordinary users, # for the system administrator).

Generalizing, the Bash prompt on armlab has the following format:&#x20;

## Simple commands

The simplest Bash command consists of just a command name which normally represents an OS utility program. :

A command name normally represents one of two things:

1. &#x20;A function that is built into Bash. This is called a Bash _built-in._&#x20;
2. An executable file. This represents either an OS utility program or a user-written program.&#x20;

The practical distinction between the two is normally irrelevant, but it does matter in certain contexts, such as when [retrieving documentation](getting-help.md) for a command, which will be covered soon.&#x20;



### Options

Many commands have specially formatted parameters, known as flags or **options**, which modify the default behavior of the command. Options are so-called because they are normally "optional. You can think of options as telling commands _how_ to complete the task. &#x20;

An option normally consists of a single character prefixed by a hyphen, but it can also consist of a full word prefixed by two hyphens. The former is called a **short option**, while the latter is called a **long option**. &#x20;

Options are defined and interpreted by the program they are supplied to, not Bash. Thus, the precise syntax and behavior of an option are program-dependent.&#x20;

Let's now invoke the `cal` command again, but this time with the `-w` option, which adds week numbers to the first column of the calendar:

Let's now invoke the `cal` command with the `-m` option, which displays the calendar with weeks starting from Monday instead of Sunday:

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2023-04-25 at 4.14.49 PM.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

As you can see, the `cal` command has multiple options. You can display a list of a command's options by going to the command's [manual or help](getting-help.md) page, which we'll cover shortly.&#x20;

### Combining options

Many programs allow single-character options to be combined. For example, in the `cal` command, we can combine the `-m` and `-w` options, and invoke them both in a single command:

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2023-04-25 at 4.15.00 PM.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

As you can see, the current month's calendar is displayed with both modifications: weeks start from Monday and are numbered in the first column.

### Arguments

An argument is a token that a command acts on, such as a filename, a string of characters, or a number. An argument usually tells a command to act upon a certain object. A command followed by an option can be thought of as telling Bash DO\_SOMETHING WITH.

We will illustrate arguments using the `sort` command, which sorts lines of text files. For example, say you have the file numbers.txt, with the numbers `5 7 3 4 8 3`, with each number on a separate line in the specified order

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2023-04-25 at 6.59.10 PM.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

You can often supply mutiple arguments simultaneously. For example, you have an identical file, numbers2.txt, but with the following numbers: 2 5 1 9 0 5 2. You can supply both numbers1.txt and numbers2.txt as arguments to sort, and it will print a sorted concatenation of both files, like so:&#x20;

### Combining options and arguments

Finally, many commands take options and arguments simultaneously allowing you to both body the behavior as well as specify an argument for it to act upon.&#x20;

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2023-04-25 at 4.13.50 PM.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

For example, you can supply the `-r` option and `numbers1.txt` argument to `sort`, which tells sort to reverse the order of the output:&#x20;

In conclusion, the general syntax for a command is as follows:
