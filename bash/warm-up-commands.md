# Getting Started

We'll begin our command line journey by executing a few simple Bash commands on armlab. To follow along with these exercises ensure you are [logged into](../armlab/background/logging-into-armlab/) armlab.&#x20;

## Shell prompt

Every shell displays a prompt on the command line. On armlab, the shell prompt looks like the following:

The prompt is generated by Bash, indicating its readiness to accept a command. It also provides useful information, such as the hostname of the computer you are logged into (armlab01 or armlab02), the working directory you are currently in (by default your home directory, which is represented by [\~](useful-command-line-features.md#tilde-expansion)), and your access level ($ for ordinary users, # for the system administrator). Generalizing, the Bash prompt on armlab has the following format:&#x20;

## Warm Up Commands

The simplest Bash command consists of just a command name:

<div align="center">

</div>

The command name usually represents a utility. For example, the `logname` utility prints out your login name:

Here are a few more simple example:

1. `hostname,` displays the hostname of the current system:

2. `uname`,which prints the name of the current operating system:

3. `date`, which displays the current date and time:

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2023-05-09 at 2.59.54 PM.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

4. `cal`, which displays a calendar for the current month, highlighting the current day:

## Options

Many commands have specially formatted parameters, known as flags or _options_, which modify the default behavior of the command. Options are so-called because they are normally "optional." You can think of options as telling commands _how_ to complete the task:

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2023-04-25 at 4.14.09 PM.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

An option normally consists of a single character prefixed by a hyphen (e.g., `-a`), but it can also consist of a full word prefixed by two hyphens (i.e., `--list`). The former is called a _short option_, and the latter is called a _long option_. &#x20;

Options are defined and interpreted by the program they are supplied to. Thus, the precise syntax and behavior of an option are dependent on the program, not Bash.&#x20;

The cal command has many options, all of which can be found in its [_manpage_](getting-help.md). Let's now invoke the `cal` command again, but this time with the `-w` option, which adds week numbers to the first column of the calendar (highlighted in red):

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2023-05-09 at 3.11.55 PM.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Let's now invoke the `cal` command with the `-m` option, which displays the calendar with weeks starting from Monday instead of Sunday:

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2023-05-09 at 3.13.46 PM.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

### Combining options

Many programs allow single-character options to be combined. For example, in the `cal` command, we can combine the `-m` and `-w` options:

## Arguments

An argument is a token that a command acts on, such as a filename, a string of characters, or a number. An argument usually tells a command to act upon a certain object:

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2023-04-25 at 6.32.35 PM.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

We will illustrate arguments using the `sort` command, which sorts lines of text files. For example, say you have the file numbers.txt, with the numbers `5 7 3 4 8 3`, each on a separate line.&#x20;

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2023-04-25 at 6.59.10 PM.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Many programs can take multiple arguments. For example, you can provide `sort` two files, and it will print a sorted concatenation of both files, like so (note that numbers2.txt contains the numbers `2 5 1 9 0 5 2`):&#x20;

## Commands with Options and Arguments

Finally, many commands take both options and arguments. You can imagine as so: &#x20;

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2023-04-25 at 4.13.50 PM.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

For example, we can run `sort numbers1.txt` again, but this time with the `-r` option, which tells sort to reverse the order of the output:&#x20;
