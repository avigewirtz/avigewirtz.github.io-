# Getting Started

We'll begin our command line journey by executing a few simple Bash commands on Armlab. If you want to follow along with these exercises, it is best if you are [logged into](../armlab/logging-into-armlab/) Armlab.&#x20;

### Shell prompt

The first thing you'll notice on the command line is the shell prompt. On Armlab, it looks like the following:

The prompt is generated by Bash, indicating its readiness to accept a command. It also provides useful information, such as the hostname of the computer you are logged into (armlab01 or armlab02), your current working directory (by default your home directory, which is represented by [\~](useful-command-line-features.md#tilde-expansion)), and your access level ($ for ordinary users, # for the system administrator). Generalizing, the Bash prompt on Armlab has the following format:&#x20;

## Warm Up Commands

As we mentioned earlier, the typical syntax of Bash commands looks like the following:

The simplest commands consist of just a command name. Here are a few examples:&#x20;

1. &#x20;`logname`, which displays your login name:

2. `hostname`, which displays the hostname of the system you're on:

3. `uname`, which displays the name of your OS:

4. `date`, which displays the current date and time:

5. `cal`, which displays a calendar for the current month:

### Options

Many commands accept arguments known as options, which modify the default behavior of the command. The cal command has many options, all of which can be found in its [_manpage_](getting-help.md). Let's now invoke the `cal` command again, but this time with the `-w` option, which adds week numbers to the first column of the calendar (highlighted in red):

Let's now invoke the `cal` command with the `-m` option, which displays the calendar with weeks starting from Monday instead of Sunday:

#### Combining options

Many programs allow single-character options to be combined. For example, in the `cal` command, we can combine the `-m` and `-w` options:

Options are defined and interpreted by the program they are supplied to. Thus, the precise syntax and behavior of an option are dependent on the program, not Bash.&#x20;

### Option-arguments



### Operands

An argument is a token that a command acts on, such as a filename, a string of characters, or a number. An argument usually tells a command to act upon a certain object:

We will illustrate arguments using the `sort` command, which sorts lines of text files. For example, say you have the file numbers.txt, with the numbers `5 7 3 4 8 3`, each on a separate line.&#x20;

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2023-04-25 at 6.59.10 PM.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Many programs can take multiple arguments. For example, you can provide `sort` two files, and it will print a sorted concatenation of both files, like so (note that numbers2.txt contains the numbers `2 5 1 9 0 5 2`):&#x20;

#### Commands with options and operands

Finally, many commands take both options and operands. &#x20;

For example, `sort numbers1.txt` with the `-r` option tells `sort` to reverse the order of the output:&#x20;
