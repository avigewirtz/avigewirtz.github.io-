# Getting Started

We'll begin our command line journey by executing a few simple Bash commands on Armlab. For the exercises in this section, we'll use the snapshot of the filesystem shown in Figure 4 as a reference.&#x20;

### Shell prompt

When you begin a bash session, the first thing you'll notice is the shell prompt. On Armlab, it looks like the following:

The prompt is generated by Bash, indicating its readiness to accept a command. It also provides us with three useful pieces of information:

* The hostname of the computer we are logged into (armlab02)
* The current working directory ([\~](useful-command-line-features.md#tilde-expansion))
* Our access level ($). For a system administrator, the symbol is  # .&#x20;

Generalizing, the Bash prompt on Armlab has the following format:&#x20;

## Warm Up Commands



The simplest commands consist of just a program or builtin name. As we mentioned earlier, a command name can represent a shell-builtin or an external program.&#x20;



Here are a few examples:&#x20;

1. `uname`, which displays the name of your OS:

4. `date`, which displays the current date and time:

5. `cal`, which displays a calendar for the current month:

### Options

Many commands accept arguments known as options, which modify the default behavior of the command. The cal command has many options, all of which can be found in its [_manpage_](getting-help.md). Let's now invoke the `cal` command again, but this time with the `-w` option, which adds week numbers to the first column of the calendar (highlighted in red):

Let's now invoke the `cal` command with the `-m` option, which displays the calendar with weeks starting from Monday instead of Sunday:

#### Combining options

Many programs allow single-character options to be combined. For example, in the `cal` command, we can combine the `-m` and `-w` options:

Options are defined and interpreted by the program they are supplied to. Thus, the precise syntax and behavior of an option are dependent on the program, not Bash.&#x20;

### Option-arguments



### Operands

An argument is a token that a command acts on, such as a filename, a string of characters, or a number. An argument usually tells a command to act upon a certain object:

We will illustrate arguments using the `sort` command, which sorts lines of text files. For example, say you have the file numbers.txt, with the numbers `5 7 3 4 8 3`, each on a separate line.&#x20;

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2023-04-25 at 6.59.10 PM.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Many programs can take multiple arguments. For example, you can provide `sort` two files, and it will print a sorted concatenation of both files, like so (note that numbers2.txt contains the numbers `2 5 1 9 0 5 2`):&#x20;

#### Commands with options and operands

Finally, many commands take both options and operands. &#x20;

For example, `sort numbers1.txt` with the `-r` option tells `sort` to reverse the order of the output:&#x20;

Shell commands typically consist of _fields_, which represent a _command name_ followed by one or more _arguments_.&#x20;

## **Command name**

A command name typically represents an executable file or a shell _built-in_, but it can also represent a _function_.&#x20;

* **Executable file**: An executable file represent any programs on the filesystem, though it typically represents a utility. There is no fundamental distinction between a utility and a regular program, except that a utility can be called by name alone (rather than _pathname_).
* **Shell built-In**: A shell built-in is a utility implemented within the shell. The difference between a shell built-in and another program is that a shell built-in represents a service provided by the shell itself, while other programs represent services provided by external programs. The practical implications of this distinction are typically not of concern to programmers, so we will not cover them here. However, whenever the distinction is pertinent, we will point it out.&#x20;
* **Function**: A function is essentially a group of commands that are defined for reuse.&#x20;

## **Argument**

An argument is a parameter passed to the executable file, shell built-in, or function. It typically represents an _option_ or an _operand_, but it can also represent an _option-argument_.&#x20;

*   **Option**: An option is an argument that changes the command's default behavior. An option normally consists of a single character prefixed by a hyphen (e.g., `-a`), but it can also consist of a full word prefixed by two hyphens (i.e., `--list`). The former is called a _short option_, and the latter is called a _long option_. &#x20;

    Options are defined and interpreted by the program they are supplied to. Thus, the precise syntax and behavior of an option are dependent on the program, not the shell. Many commands allow several short options to be combined.&#x20;
* **Option-Argument**: An option-argument is a parameter that follows certain options. For example, the `-o` option in the `gcc` command uses an argumentâ€”an output filename such as `hello`.
* **Operand**: An operand specifies the data that the command manipulates or operates on, usually representing a literal, variable, or filename. (Note that in this context we use the term _file_ broadly to include directories.) Commands often allow multiple operands to be supplied together. The order of options and operands can be significant, depending on the command.&#x20;

The syntax of a shell command can generally be summarized as follows:
