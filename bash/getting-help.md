# Getting Help

Each Bash command has associated documentation that can be accessed from the command line. Such documentation is helpful when you need a refresher for a command or want more information about the commandâ€™s specifics.&#x20;

The method of documentation differs depending on the type of command you are retrieving documentation for. A command normally represents one of two things:&#x20;

* A shell _built-in_, which is a utility that is implemented within Bash. &#x20;
* An external program--either an OS utility program or a user-written program.&#x20;

The practical distinction between the two is normally irrelevant, but it does matter in certain contexts, such as when retrieving documentation for a command. Specifically, the commands used to retrieve documentation for utility programs are different than the ones used for shell builtins, and vice versa.

## Documentation for Utility Programs

To retrieve documentation for a utility program, you can use the `man` command followed by the name of the utility. For example, `man cal` will display the manual page (_manpage_) for the `cal` utility. The output will be sent through the _less_ pager, which displays the output one screen at a time. On armlab, the following page will be displayed:&#x20;

## Documentation for Bash Built-ins

If you want documentation for a Bash built-in, you must use the `help` instead of the `man`. For example, to retrieve documentation for the bash built-it `exit`, invoke:

### How to determine if a command is a Bash built-in or a Utility&#x20;

Here are two methods you can use to determine if a command is a Bash built-in or a utility program.&#x20;

1. You can simply try `man` command, and if `man` succeeds, great. If not, Bash will return the following page, telling you that the command is a built-in:&#x20;

2. You can use the `type` command. For example, to check if the `exit` command is a Bash built-in, run:
