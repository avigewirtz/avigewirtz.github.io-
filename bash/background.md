# Background

BASH, short for "Bourne-Again SHell," is a popular shell developed by the [GNU Project](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU\_Project) that is the default shell on many Linux distributions.&#x20;

In addition to providing users with simple commands for tasks like file management, and process management, Bash supports a variety of programming constructs, including loops, conditional statements, functions, and variables.&#x20;

In COS217, you will learn how to use Bash to perform various tasks, such as navigating the filesystem and creating and manipulating files and directories. You will also learn about important concepts such as environment variables, redirection & piping, and file access permissions.&#x20;

While you will only be scratching the surface of what Bash is capable of, the knowledge you acquire will provide you with a solid foundation that you can build on in the future.&#x20;
