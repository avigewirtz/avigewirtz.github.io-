# What is Bash?

BASH, short for "Bourne-Again SHell," is a popular Unix-shell developed by the [GNU Project](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU\_Project). It is the default shell on many Linux distributions.&#x20;

The purpose of Bash, like all shells, is to implement the command line interface. It provides you with a language with which top interact with the operating system kernel.&#x20;



Bash is a [command processor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line\_interpreter) that typically runs in a [text window](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terminal\_emulator) where the user types commands that cause actions. Bash can also read and execute commands from a file, called a [shell script](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shell\_script).



Some of these commands are built into bash itself; others are separate programs. For now, it doesn’t make a difference which are which.

Bash, along with most other unix-shells, offer many convenient features beyond launching programs and providing builtins.&#x20;

&#x20;For example, they remember commands that you’ve typed, and let you reuse those commands. Modern shells also let you edit those commands, so they don’t have to be the same each time. And modern shells let you define your own command abbreviations, shortcuts, and other features. For an experienced user, typing commands (e.g., with shorthand, shortcuts, and command completion) is a lot more efficient and effective than dragging things around in a fancy windowed interface.
