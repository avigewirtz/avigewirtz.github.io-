# Background

Bash, short for "Bourne-Again SHell," is a popular shell developed by the [GNU Project](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU\_Project) that is the default shell on many Linux distributions.&#x20;

Bash is an incredibly powerful tool. In addition to providing users with simple commands for navigating and manipulating files and directories, Bash supports a variety of programming constructs, including loops, conditional statements, functions, and variables. This makes it a versatile tool that can be used for a wide range of tasks, from simple file management to advanced system administration.&#x20;

In COS217, you will learn how to use Bash to perform various tasks, such as navigating your file system, creating and manipulating files and directories, and automating repetitive tasks using shell scripting. You will also learn about important Bash concepts such as environment variables, redirection & piping, and file access permissions.&#x20;

While you will only be scratching the surface of what Bash is capable of in this course, the knowledge you acquire will provide you with a solid foundation that you can build on in the future.

All Linux shells are very similar to each other, so learning one will make it extremely easy to pick up another.
