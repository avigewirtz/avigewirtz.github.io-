# How Information is Represented in Computers



<details>

<summary>A brief overview of how computers represent images, audio, and video</summary>

* Images: Images are represented as a matrix of pixels, where each pixel corresponds to a specific color. The color information is represented using various color models, such as RGB (Red, Green, Blue) or CMYK (Cyan, Magenta, Yellow, Key/Black). Each color channel is represented by a specific number of bits, which determines the range of color values that can be represented.

* Audio: Audio data is typically represented as a continuous waveform, which is then sampled at regular intervals to create a digital representation. Each sample represents the amplitude of the waveform at a specific point in time, and the samples are stored using various audio formats and encoding techniques.

* Video: Video data is essentially a sequence of images (frames) displayed over time. Each frame is represented using image data formats, and the sequence of frames is stored using various video encoding and compression techniques to reduce the file size while maintaining an acceptable level of quality.
