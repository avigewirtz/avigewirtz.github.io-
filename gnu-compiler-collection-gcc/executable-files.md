# Executable files

Executable files, which contain the binary code for a program, have a specific format that distinguishes them from other types of files. The precise format can depend on the operating system and the architecture of the machine, but most executable file formats include a header section that provides metadata about the file.

This header contains information such as:

* The type of the file (confirming that it is an executable)
* The machine architecture for which the code was compiled (such as x86 or ARM)
* The entry point of the program (where execution should begin)
* The size and location of the code and data sections

The operating system uses this metadata to correctly interpret the binary data in the file. When the OS loads an executable file into memory to run it, it will interpret the binary data in the 'text' or 'code' section of the file as machine instructions according to the instruction set architecture specified in the header. Other sections of the file will be interpreted as data or resources used by the program.

In summary, the operating system knows that the binary data in an executable file represents instructions because the file follows a specific format that tells the OS how to interpret the data. The OS uses this information to load and execute the program correctly.
