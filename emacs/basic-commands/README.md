# Getting Started

Before exploring Emacs commands, it's important to familiarize yourself with the standard notation used for key sequences. Here are a few examples of key sequence notation used in this tutorial:

* **C-x**: Hold the Control key and press the "x" key.
* **C-x C-c**: Hold the Control key and press the "x" key, then release both keys and hold the Control key again while pressing the "c" key.
* **C-x 1**: Hold the Control key and press the "x" key, then release both keys and press the "1" key.
* **C-x l 5**: Hold the Control key and press the "x" key, then release both keys and press the "l" key, then release "I" key and press the "5" key.
* **C-x C-w file**: Hold the Control key and press the "x" key, then release both keys and hold the Control key again while pressing the "w" key. After that, release both keys and type the desired file name (replacing "file" with the actual file name) and press "Enter" or "Return" to complete the command.&#x20;

### Launching Emacs

Run `emacs file_name` on the command line, where file\_name is the name of the file you want to create or edit.&#x20;

### Exiting Emacs

Invoke `C-x C-c`. If you have unsaved changes, Emacs will prompt you to save the changes before exiting.
