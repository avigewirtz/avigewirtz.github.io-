# Basic Commands

Before exploring Emacs commands, it's important to familiarize yourself with the standard notation used for key sequences, which play a crucial role in executing commands. Here are a few examples of key sequence notation used in this tutorial:

* **C-x**: Hold the Control key and press the "x" key.
* **C-x C-c**: Hold the Control key and press the "x" key, then release both keys and hold the Control key again while pressing the "c" key.
* **C-x 1**: Hold the Control key and press the "x" key, then release both keys and press the "1" key.
* **C-x l 5**: Hold the Control key and press the "x" key, then release both keys and press the "l" key, followed by the "5" key.
* **C-x C-w file**: Hold the Control key and press the "x" key, then release both keys and hold the Control key again while pressing the "w" key. After that, release both keys and type the desired file name (replacing "file" with the actual file name) and press "Enter" or "Return" to complete the command.&#x20;
