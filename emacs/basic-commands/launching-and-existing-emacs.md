# Launching and Existing Emacs

### Launching Emacs

Run `emacs file_name` on the command line. Emacs will launch and open the specified file in a new buffer. If the specified file doesn't exist, Emacs will create a new buffer with the specified name.

### Exiting Emacs

You can exit Emacs by invoking `C-x C-c`. If you have unsaved changes, Emacs will prompt you to save the changes before exiting.
