# Emacs Configuration Files

The `.emacs` file is a user-specific configuration file for Emacs. It is a plain text file that contains Emacs Lisp code and is located in the user's home directory. When Emacs starts up, it reads and executes the `.emacs` file, which allows the user to customize Emacs to their liking.

Although familiarity with the _.emacs_ configuration file is not necessary in COS217, here are some common use cases for future reference:&#x20;

1. Setting global variables: You can set global variables in your `.emacs` file to customize the behavior of Emacs. For example, you can set the default font or change the color scheme.
2. Defining custom functions: You can define your own functions in Emacs Lisp and use them in Emacs. This is useful for automating repetitive tasks or extending the functionality of Emacs.
3. Loading packages: Emacs has a built-in package manager that allows you to install and use third-party packages. You can load these packages in your `.emacs` file to extend the functionality of Emacs.
4. Keybindings: You can define custom keybindings for Emacs commands in your `.emacs` file. This allows you to use the keyboard shortcuts that you prefer for certain commands.
