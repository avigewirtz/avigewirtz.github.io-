# Emacs Modes

Emacs operates in various **modes**. Modes provide language-specific or file-format-specific features, such as syntax highlighting, indentation, and code completion, making editing and navigating files easier.&#x20;

Within the scope of COS217, you will primarily work with four modes: C mode, Assembler mode, Text mode, and Fundamental mode. Emacs automatically selects the appropriate mode based on the filename extension:

* .c: C mode
* .s: Assembler mode
* .txt: Text mode
* No extension: Fundamental mode
