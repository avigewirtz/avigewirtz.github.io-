# Key Sequence Notation

In Emacs, key sequences are used extensively for executing commands and functions. Thus, it is essential to understand the standard notation for key sequences.

C = control key

M = Meta key

* **C-x**: Hold the Control key and press the "x" key.
* **C-x C-c**: Hold the Control key and press the "x" key, then release both keys and hold the Control key again while pressing the "c" key.
* **C-x 1**: Hold the Control key and press the "x" key, then release both keys and press the "1" key.
* **C-x l 5**: Hold the Control key and press the "x" key, then release both keys and press the "l" key, followed by the "5" key.
* **C-x C-w file**: Hold the Control key and press the "x" key, then release both keys and hold the Control key again while pressing the "w" key. After that, release both keys and type the desired file name (replacing "file" with the actual file name) and press "Enter" or "Return" to complete the command.&#x20;
