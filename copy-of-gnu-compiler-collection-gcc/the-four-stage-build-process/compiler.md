### **Compilation Proper**

The next stage involves translating the preprocessed C source code into assembly language. Assembly language is essentially a human-readable version of machisp\[]\\;bm ,./oyg

There are many different assembly languages out there today.&#x20;

Note that the this stage is by far the most resource intensive of all four stages in the build process, since C (or any high level lanuage) and assembly are two completely different types of programming languages This stage is the most resource intensive of all four stages and constitutes the bulk of the work of GCC.&#x20;







This is where the high-level constructs (like loops, conditionals, etc.)&#x20;
