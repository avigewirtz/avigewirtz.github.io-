# Git Installation

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="macOS" %}
There are many ways to install Git on macOS. The easiest method is by installing the Xcode Command Line Tools, which includes a version of Git.&#x20;

* Run the following command in Terminal: `git -v`. If Git is already installed, the command will output `git version x.y.z`. Otherwise, it will prompt you to install Xcode Command Line Tool.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
Note that the version of Git included with Xcode is not necessarily the latest version. If you specifically want the latest version, download Git using the official Git [installer](https://git-scm.com/download/mac).&#x20;
{% endhint %}
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Windows" %}
You may already have Git installed thanks to the introcs infrastructure from COS 126, which installs Git Bash. If this is not the case, then browse to http://git- scm.com/download/win and the download and install will start automatically.
