# Interpreting Gprof Output

The Gprof report consists of two main sections: the flat profile and the call graph. The flat profile provides an overview of the program's performance, listing each function's total execution time, number of calls, and average time per call. The call graph, on the other hand, displays a more detailed breakdown of each function's callers and callees, offering insights into the relationships between functions and their contributions to the overall execution time.
