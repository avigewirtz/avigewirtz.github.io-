# About This Tutorial

### Target Audience

This guide is specifically designed for students currently enrolled in _COS217: Introduction to Programming Systems_. As such, it presupposes familiarity with fundamental programming concepts covered in COS126.&#x20;

### Computing Environment

All code examples in this guide have been executed on Princeton's Armlab computer, which runs on the Red Hat Linux distribution. While these examples are anticipated to function on other Unix-like operating systems, such as macOS, minor variations may occur.

### Conventions Used

_Italic_

> Indicates new terms, URLs, and filenames.

`Code blocks`

> Used for URLs, and filenames, as well as within paragraphs to refer to program elements such as variable or function names, data types, environment variables, statements, and keywords.

All-CAPS

> Signifies a placeholder, meaning text that should be substituted with user-provided values. For example, `mkdir DIRECTORY_NAME`  means you should replace `DIRECTORY_NAME` with your own value.
