# Organization of this tutorial

We've arranged the chapters to give you a gentle and enjoyable entry into UNIX and the tools on the disk. We start with basic utilities you'll use right away, like the Emacs text editor and the C compiler, and continue to more advanced tools that you'll be glad are there, such as make and RCS. The first two chapters are general and do not directly concern the software on the disk; later chapters are about par- ticular tools on the disk.

### Part 1: Armlab

The first part of the book covers the basics of setting up and managing your Armlab account. It introduces the Secure Shell (SSH) protocol, walks through logging in and out of Armlab, and provides an overview on configuring your Armlab environment.

### Part 2: Linux

The second part is dedicated to Linux. It gives a thorough explanation of the user interface, terminal, shell, and syntax of shell commands, along with an overview of the operating system. It also covers the Linux filesystem, including files and directories, filenames, filesystem layout, notable directories, and pathnames.

### Part 3: Bash

Part 3 covers the Bash shell. It starts with the basic steps to get started with Bash, then moves on to useful command-line features. It covers a variety of tasks like navigating the filesystem, creating and deleting files and directories, understanding working directories, redirection and piping, as well as copying, moving, and renaming files. It also touches on concepts like users and groups, file and directory access permissions, Linux environment variables, Bash configuration files, and how Bash executes commands.

### Part 4: Emacs

Part 4 covers Emacs, a widely-used text editor. It covers the fundamentals for editing files as well as more advanced commands like managing windows and buffers, search and replace, and building with Emacs. It also touches on Emacs configuration files and provides an Emacs cheat sheet.

### Part 5: Git & GitHub

The next portion delves into Git & GitHub, explaining how to set up your Git environment and use Git fundamentals. It also walks you through obtaining and creating repositories, authentication, Git workflow, and pushing and pulling. It discusses important Git commands, such as checking the status of your repository, viewing commit history, ignoring files, and resolving merge conflicts.

### Part 6: Gnu Compiler Collection (GCC)

The GCC section breaks down the four-stage build process, with the intention of helping you understand each stage from machine code to high-level languages.

### Part 7: Make

The Make section explains code reusability, dependencies, build automation, and Makefiles.

### Part 8: Gprof

Finally, the book concludes with a chapter on Gprof, detailing how Gprof works, using Gprof, and interpreting Gprof output. It covers the flat profile and call graph.

Each chapter offers further reading suggestions to deepen your understanding. This book is designed to equip you with a working foundation for using Bash, Emacs, Git & GitHub, GCC, Make, and Gprof.
