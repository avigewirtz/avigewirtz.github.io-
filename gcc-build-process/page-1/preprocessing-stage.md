# Preprocessing stage

As we mentioned earlier, the preprocessor performs two main tasks: It removes comments, which are of no use to the compiler, and handles preprocessor directives, which are lines in the code that begin with a #. Our program makes use of three types of preprocessor directives: `#include`, `#define`, and `#ifndef`/ `#endif`. These directives control file inclusion, macro definition, and conditional compilation respectively.

#### File Inclusion

The `#include` directive instructs the preprocessor to grab the contents of a specified file and paste it directly into the current file where the `#include` directive appears. For example, in `testcircle.c`, the preprocessor replaces `#include <stdio.h>` with the contents of `stdio.h`, a system header file that contains, among other things, declarations of standard I/O functions such as `printf` and `scanf`.

{% hint style="info" %}
`#included` files are typically header files, but technically any file can be included.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
There are two syntaxes for the `#include` directive: with angle brackets (e.g., `#include <stdio.h>`), and with double quotes (e.g., `#include "circle.h"`). The difference between these two lies in how the preprocessor searches for the specified file, with the precise details being implementation-defined. In general, files included with angle brackets are searched for in system directories only, while those included with double quotes are searched for in the working directory first.
{% endhint %}

#### Macro Definition

The `#define` directive creates a preprocessor macro, which is essentially an alias for a specific value or code snippet. In circle.c, for example, `#define PI 3.14159` creates the macro `PI` and assigns it the value `3.14159`. Whenever `PI` is subsequently used in `circle.c`, the preprocessor replaces it with `3.14159`.

#### Conditional Compilation

The `#ifndef` / `#else` directives, which we use in `intmath.h`, are part of a set of directives known as _conditional_ _directives_. These are used to control which parts of the source code are sent to the compiler. One of their most common use cases is to prevent the contents of a header file from being included twice in the same compilation unit (i.e., `.i` file). This technique is known as an _#include guard_. Here's how it works in `intmath.h`:

* `#ifndef CIRCLE_H`: This checks if the macro `CIRCLE_H` is defined. If this evaluates to TRUE (i.e., `CIRCLE_H` is not defined), the preprocessor continues to process the code between `#ifndef` and `#endif`. If it evaluates to FALSE, the preprocessor skips the entire block within the `#ifndef` ... `#endif`.
* `#define CIRCLE_H`: This defines `CIRCLE_H`. Notice that it doesn't give CIRCLE\_H. Any specific value. That is fine.&#x20;
* `#endif`: This line ends the conditional preprocessor directive started by `#ifndef`.&#x20;

#### Examining `testcircle.i` and `circle.i`

You can examine the preprocessed files with a text editor. Letâ€™s examine `testcircle.i` and `circle.i` to see what precisely was done by the preprocessor. A side-by-side comparison is shown in Figure 12.

First, we see that the preprocessor removed all comments from `testcircle.c` and `circle.c`. Second, it replaced each `#include` directive with the contents of its specified header: `circle.h` for both `circle.c` and `testcircle.c`, and `stdio.h` and `stdlib.h` for `testcircle.c`. The `stdio.h` file contains declarations for the `printf` and `scanf` functions, while `stdlib.h` includes the declaration for the `exit` function and the definition of the `EXIT_FAILURE` macro. Finally, all macros were expanded: `PI` in `circle.c` was replaced with `3.14159`, and `EXIT_FAILURE` was replaced with `1`.

{% hint style="success" %}
You can think of the preprocessor as a "search-and-replace" tool:

* It replaces each comment with a whitespace character.
* It replaces each `#include` directive with the contents of the specified file.
* It replaces each macro with its value.
