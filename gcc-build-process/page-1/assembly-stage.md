# Assembly stage

## Assembly Stage

The assembler translates the assembly-language in testcircle.s and circle.s into machine language, storing the results in testcircle.o and circle.o. This process is shown in Figure 4.3. Machine language is a binary language, consisting of only two symbols--0 and 1.
