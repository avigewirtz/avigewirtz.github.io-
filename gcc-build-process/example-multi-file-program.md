# Example: Multi-file Program

In our previous example, all the source code of our program was contained within a single .c fileâ€”charcount.c. As we know, however, the source code of a C program may be distributed across any number of files. In such a case, the underlying operations get more interesting, and the true power of the linker is more appreciated. 


Let's now walk through the four stage build process again, but this time, let's use a multi-file program as an example. We'll use the testintmath program from prevept four. we'll go over the details in much less detail, since we already covered it previously. the main point we want ti teach here is how the process works with multiple files.
