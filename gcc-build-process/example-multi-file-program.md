# Example: Multi-file Program

In our previous example, all the source code of our program was contained within a single .c fileâ€”charcount.c. As we know, however, the source code of a C program may be distributed across any number of files. In such a case, the underlying operations get more interesting, and the true power of the linker is more appreciated. 


Let's now walk through the four stage build process again, but this time, let's use a multi-file program as an example. We'll use the testintmath program from prevept four. we'll go over the process in much less detail, since much of the details remain the same. the emphasis here is on the multi-file aspect of the build process.
