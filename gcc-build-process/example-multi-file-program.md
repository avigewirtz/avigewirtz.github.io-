# Example: Multi-file Program

In our previous example, all the source code of our program was contained within a single .c fileâ€”charcount.c. As we know, however, the source code of a C program may be distributed across any number of files. Suppose our program were divided across multiple files. What would the underlying build process look like? 


Let's now walk through the four stage build process again, but this time, let's use a multi-file program as an example. We'll use the testintmath program from prevept four.
