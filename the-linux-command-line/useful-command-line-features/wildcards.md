# Wildcards

### **Wildcards**

Wildcards are characters that can represent any number of characters or a specific range of characters in a pattern. They are helpful when you need to perform an operation on multiple files or directories that share a similar naming pattern. The two most commonly used wildcards in Bash are:

* `*` (asterisk): Represents any number of characters (including zero characters). For example, `*.txt` matches all .txt files in the current directory.&#x20;
* `?` (question mark): Represents exactly one character. For example, `file?.txt` matches files like `file1.txt`, `file2.txt`, but not `file12.txt`.
