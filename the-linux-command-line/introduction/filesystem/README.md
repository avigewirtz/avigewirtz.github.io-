# Linux Filesystem

One of the most fundamental services provided by the operating system is the notion of a filesystem, which is an abstracted model of computer storage. From the user's point of view, the filesystem consists of two main components:&#x20;

1. A collection of files.
2. A directory structure that organizes these files.&#x20;
