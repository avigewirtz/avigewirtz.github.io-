# Home Directory +

Each user on a Linux system has a personal directory called a _home directory_. This is a designated space to store personal files and directories. On Armlab, your home directory is located in the `/u` directory and is named after your NetID. For example, if your NetID is "tal5", your home directory would be `/u/tal5` (Figure 15). By default, the contents of your home directory are not accessible to other users (with the exception of the system administrator).
