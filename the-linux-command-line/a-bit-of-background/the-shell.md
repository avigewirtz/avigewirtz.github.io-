# The Shell

when we issue commands in the terminal

Bash, along with most other unix-shells, offer many convenient features beyond launching programs and providing builtins.&#x20;

&#x20;For example, they remember commands that you’ve typed, and let you reuse those commands. Modern shells also let you edit those commands, so they don’t have to be the same each time. And modern shells let you define your own command abbreviations, shortcuts, and other features. For an experienced user, typing commands (e.g., with shorthand, shortcuts, and command completion) is a lot more efficient and effective than dragging things around in a fancy windowed interface.
