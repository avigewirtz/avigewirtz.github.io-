# Deleting Files and Directories

### Deleting Files

To delete a file, type `rm` (**r**e**m**ove) followed by the name of the file you want to delete. For example, to delete `file1`:

```bash
rm file1
```

To delete multiple files, type `rm` followed by the name of each of the files you want to delete. For example, to delete `file1`, `file2`, and `file3`:

```bash
rm file2 file3 file4
```

Deleting files and directories is a dangerous operation that should be exercised with caution. If youâ€™re not careful, Linux will do exactly what you ask it to, up to deleting every last one of your files and directories. The contents may not be recoverable.

A wise approach is to always invoke `rm` with the `-i` option, which prompts you for confirmation before deleting a file. Respond "y" to proceed and "n" to abort. For example:

```bash
$ rm -i file1
remove file1? y
$
```

It's common practice to alias `rm` to `rm -i`, ensuring you're always prompted for confirmation before deleting a file. This alias is already set up on Armlab. To set it up on your PC, add the following line to your `.bashrc` file:

```bash
alias rm='rm -i'
```

If you are sure about deleting a file and do not want to be prompted for confirmation, you can override`-i` with the`-f` (force) option:

```bash
rm -f file1 # expands to 'rm -i -f file1'
```

This works since options specified later on the command line take precedence.

### Deleting Directories

To delete directories, you can use the rm command on the way you used it for files, except you have to add the `-r` (recursive) option. For example, to delete `non_empty_dir`:

```bash
rm -r non_empty_dir
```
This deletes non_empty_dir, along with all the files in it. 




{% hint style="info" %}
It may seem that `rmdir` is redundant, since `rm -r` can handle both empty and non-empty directories. However, `rmdir` is safer because it ensures you do not accidentally delete non-empty directories.

### Deleting Empty Directories

The `rm -r` command can be used to delete both empty and non-empty directories. However, Linux provides the `rmdir` (**r**e**m**ove empty **dir**ectory/ies) command as well, which only works if the directory is empty. It comes in handy when you want to delete a directory only if it is empty, without having to first check if it's empty. Type `rmdir` followed by the name of the directory you want to delete. For example, to delete empty directory `dir1`:

```bash
rmdir dir1
```

To delete multiple empty directories, type `rmdir` followed by the name of each of the directories you want to delete. For example, to delete `dir2`, `dir3`, and `dir4`:

```bash
rmdir dir2 dir3 dir4
```

{% hint style="warning" %}
If you attempt to delete a non-empty directory with `rmdir`, you'll get a "Directory not empty" error:

```bash
$ rmdir dir1
rmdir: dir1: Directory not empty
$
```
{% endhint %}
