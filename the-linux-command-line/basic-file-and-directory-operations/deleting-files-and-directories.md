# Deleting Files and Directories

### Deleting Files

To delete a file, type `rm` (**r**e**m**ove) followed by the name of the file you want to delete. For example, to delete `file1`:

```bash
rm file1
```

To delete multiple files, supply the name of each file you want to delete as an argument to `rm`. For example, to delete `file1`, `file2`, and `file3`:

```bash
rm file2 file3 file4
```

Deleting files and directories is a dangerous operation that should be exercised with caution. If youâ€™re not careful, Linux will do exactly what you tell it to, up to deleting every last one of your files and directories. The contents may not be recoverable.

A wise approach is to always invoke `rm` with the `-i` option, which prompts you for confirmation before deleting a file. Respond "y" to proceed and "n" to abort For example:

```bash
$ rm -i file1
remove file1? y
$
```

It's common practice to alias `rm` to `rm -i`, ensuring you're always prompted for confirmation before deleting a file. This alias is already set up on Armlab. You can set it up on your PC by adding the following line to your `.bashrc` file:

```
alias rm='rm -i'
```

If you are sure about deleting a file and do not want to be prompted for confirmation, you can override `-i` with the`-f` (force) option:

```bash
$ rm -f file1
```
{% endhint %}

### Deleting Empty Directories

If the directory you want to delete is empty, you can use the `rmdir` (**r**e**m**ove **dir**ectory/ies) command. Type `rmdir` followed by the name of the directory you want to delete. For example, to delete `dir1`:

```bash
rmdir dir1
```

To delete multiple empty directories, supply the name of each directory as an argument to `rmdir`. For example, do delete `dir2`, `dir3`, and `dir4`:

```bash
rmdir dir2 dir3 dir4
```

{% hint style="warning" %}
If you attempt to delete a non-empty directory with `rmdir`, you'll get an error:

```bash
$ rmdir dir1
rmdir: dir1: Directory not empty
$
```
{% endhint %}

### Deleting Non-empty Directories

To delete non-empty directories, use the `rm` command with the `-r` option. For example, to delete `non_empty_dir`:

```bash
rm -r non_empty_dir
```

{% hint style="info" %}
It may seem that `rmdir` is redundant, since `rm -r` can handle both empty and non-empty directories. However, `rmdir` is safer because it ensures you do not accidentally delete non-empty directories.
