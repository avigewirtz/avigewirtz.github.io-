# Creating Files/Directories

## Creating Directories

To create a new directory, use the `mkdir` command followed by the name of the directory you want to create. For example, to create `dir1`, invoke:&#x20;

```bash
mkdir dir1
```

dir1 will be created in the working directory

### Creating multiple directories

Multiple directories can be created via a single invocation of `mkdir` by supplying multiple directory names as arguments. For example:

```bash
mkdir dir1 dir2 dir3
```

### Creating a directory with whitespace in its name

Suppose we want to create a directory named `assignment 1`. As you can probably guess, invoking:

```bash
mkdir assignment 1
```

will not work; it'll create two directories--`assignment`, and `1`. A simple solution is to enclose the directiory name in quotation marks:

```bash
mkdir "assignment 1"
```

This will create a single directory named `assignment 1`.

## Creating Files

There are numerous commands you can use to create files. We'll cover two: `touch`, and `emacs`.&#x20;

### touch

The simplest way to create a file is via the `touch` command. Simply invoke `touch` followed by the names of one or more files you want to create. For example:

```
touch file1 file2 file3
```

Note that if one of the files supplied as an argument to `touch` already exists, `touch` will update its last modification timestamp to the current time.&#x20;

The limitation with `touch` is that it cannot be used to view or edit files. It is strictly for creating new, empty files or for updating the timestamps of existing files.

### **emacs**

If your goal is to create a file and immediately begin working in it, your best bet is to do so via a text editor like Emacs. Simply invoke `emacs` followed by the name of the file you want to create:

```
emacs file1
```

{% hint style="warning" %}
Technically, `emacs file1` does not actually create `file1`. It creates a temporary buffer in memory. The physical file is only created on disk when you save your changes within Emacs. This is done by pressing `Ctrl + x` followed by `Ctrl + s`.

## Deleting files and directories



<details>

<summary>Common options</summary>

* **`-r`**: Deletes directory(ies), even if they are not empty.

<!---->

* **`-i`**: Prompts the user for confirmation before deleting each file/directory.&#x20;

<!---->

* **`-f`**: Overrides `-i` option (i.e., removes confirmation prompt).

</details>

{% hint style="danger" %}
Deleting files and directories is a dangerous operation, and should be used with caution. If youâ€™re not careful, Linux will do exactly what you tell it to do, up to deleting every last one of your files and directories.&#x20;

### Exercises

1. Delete _dir1_ using `rmdir`:

The operation succeeds since _dir1_ is empty.

2. Delete _dir2_ using `rmdir`:

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2023-04-26 at 4.23.00 PM.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

The operation fails since _dir2_ is not empty.&#x20;

3. Let's clean things up a bit. Delete _dir3_, _dir4_, _bad_, _name_, and '_bad name_':

4. Delete _file1_:

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2023-04-26 at 4.29.21 PM.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

The prompt `rm: remove regular empty file 'file1'?`  is displayed because on Armlab, `rm` is aliased to `rm -i`.&#x20;

2. Delete _dir2_:

3. Delete _file3_ and _file4_ using the `-f` option, which removes the confirmation prompt:
