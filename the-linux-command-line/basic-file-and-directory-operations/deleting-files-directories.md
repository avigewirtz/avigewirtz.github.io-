# Deleting Files/Directories

## Deleting files

To delete a file, use the `rm` (**r**e**m**ove) command followed by the name of the file you want to delete. For example, to delete `file1`, invoke:

```bash
rm file1
```

To delete multiple files, supply the name of each file as an argument to `rm`. For example:

```
rm file1 file2 file3
```

Deleting files and directories is a dangerous operation that should be exercised with caution. If youâ€™re not careful, Linux will do exactly what you tell it to do, up to deleting every last one of your account's files and directories. The contents may not be recoverable.&#x20;

A sound approach is to invoke `rm` with the `-i` option, which prompts you for confirmation before deleting a file. Respond "y" to proceed and "n" to abort  For example:&#x20;

```bash
$ rm file1
remove file1? y
$
```

It's common practice to setup up your environment so that you are always prompted before deleting a file, even when you don't explicitly use the `-i` option. This is done by aliasing `rm` to `rm -i`. This alias is already set up on Armlab. To set it up on your PC, add the following line to the `.bashrc` file in your home directory:

```
alias rm='rm -i'
```

Going forward, if you attempt to delete a file, it'll prompt you for confirmation. If you are sure about deleting a file and do not want to be prompted, use the `-f` option:

```bash
$ rm -f file1
```
{% endhint %}

## Deleting directories

If the directory you want to delete is empty, you can use the `rmdir` (**r**e**m**ove **dir**ectory/ies) command. For example, to delete `dir1`:

```bash
rmdir dir1
```

To delete multiple directories, supply the name of each directory as an argument to `rmdir`. For example:&#x20;

```bash
rmdir dir1 dir2 dir2
```

`rmdir` only works for empty directories. If you attempt to delete a non-empty directory, you'll get the following error:&#x20;

```bash
$ rmdir dir1
rmdir: hgh: Directory not empty
$
```

### Deleting non-empty directories

To delete non-empty directories, you need to use the `rm` command with the `-r` option. For example, to delete `non_empty_dir`:

```bash
rm -r non_empty_dir
```

{% hint style="info" %}
It may seem that `rmdir` is redundant, since `rm -r` can handle both empty and non-empty directories. However, `rmdir` is safer because it ensures you do not accidentally delete non-empty directories.
