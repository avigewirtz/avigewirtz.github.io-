# Deleting Files/Directories

## Deleting files

Deleting files and directories is a dangerous operation that should be exercised with caution. If youâ€™re not careful, Linux will do exactly what you tell it to do, up to deleting every last one of your account's files and directories. The contents may not be recoverable.&#x20;

A good approach is to invoke `rm` with the `-i` option, which prompts you for confirmation before deleting a file. Respond "y" to proceed and "n" to abort  For example:&#x20;

```bash
$ rm file1
remove file1? y
$
```

A common practice is to setup up your environment so that a confirmation prompt is the default. This is done by aliasing `rm` to `rm -i`. This alias is already set up for your account on Armlab. To set it up on your PC, add the following line to the `.bashrc` file in your home directory:

```
alias rm='rm -i'
```

Going forward, if you attempt to delete a file, it'll prompt you for confirmation. If you are sure about deleting a file and do not want to be prompted, use the `-f` option:

```bash
$ rm -f file1
```
{% endhint %}

## Deleting directories

If the directory you want to delete is empty, you can use the `rmdir` (**r**e**m**ove **dir**ectory/ies) command. For example:

```bash
rmdir dir1
```

You can also delete multiple directories via a single invocation of rmdir. For example:

```bash
rmdir dir1 dir2 dir2
```

If the directory you want to delete is not empty, `rmdir` will not work. You will get the following error:

### Deleting non-empty directories

To delete non-empty directories, use the `rm` command with the `-r` option. For example:

```bash
rm -r dir1 
```
