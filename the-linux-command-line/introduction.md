# Introduction

When Linus Torvalds introduced Linux and for a long time thereafter, Linux did not have a graphical user interface (GUI). It ran on character-based terminals only, using a command-line interface (CLI), also referred to as a textual interface. All the tools ran from a command line. Today the Linux GUI is important, but many people— especially system administrators—run many command-line utilities. Command-line utilities are often faster,! \more powerful, or more complete than their GUI counterparts. Sometimes there is no GUI counterpart to a textual utility; some people just prefer the hands-on feeling of the command line.

When you work with a command-line interface, you are working with a shell. Before you start working with a shell, it is important that you understand a basic understanding of the componentds of a Linux system and how they interact with each other.&#x20;



#### Outline of this chapter

The command-line interface (CLI) is a text-based method of interacting with your computer. Unlike the graphical user interfaces (GUIs) that allow you to issue commands by clicking buttons and icons, a CLI requires you to issue commands by typing typing sequences of text in a [terminal](broken-reference).&#x20;

Imagine using a CLI as if you're texting with your computer: you type in your request, and it responds  with text output. Let's consider a couple of examples of computer interaction to highlight the distinction between a GUI and CLI.&#x20;

## Terminal

CLI commands are issued via a _terminal_. In the nascent days of interactive computing, terminals were hardware devices, consisting of a keyboard and a display unit. The first terminals were teleprinter machines, such as the Teletype Model 33 ASR shown in Figure 1, whose display unit was a paper-roll printer.

Teletypes fell out of use in the 1970s with the advent of video display terminals, such as the DEC VT100 shown in Figure 2, which provided instant user-feedback and editing capabilities.&#x20;

Today, hardware terminals are largely obsolete. The predominant method for accessing the CLI is through a _terminal emulator_, which is a GUI program that simulates the functionality of a hardware terminal. An example of a terminal emulator is macOS's Terminal, shown in Figure 3.&#x20;
