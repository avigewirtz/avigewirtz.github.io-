# GNU Core Utilities

Core utilities, often referred to as "coreutils," are standalone programs that use these library functions to provide a standard set of features to programmers. The core utilities essentially act as a toolbox, providing programmers with ready-to-use tools for most of the basic tasks they might need to perform, such as file management and text processing.&#x20;

Utilities are usually packaged with the operating system and installed by default. However, they are generally not considered part of the operating system itself. The operating system's core is the kernel, which interacts directly with the hardware. Core utilities, on the other hand, operate at a higher level.
