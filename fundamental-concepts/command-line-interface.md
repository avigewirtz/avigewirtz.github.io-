# Command Line Interface

The command-line interface (CLI) is a text-based method of interacting with your computer. Unlike the graphical user interfaces (GUIs) that allow you to issue commands by clicking buttons and icons, a CLI requires you to issue commands by typing typing sequences of text in a [terminal](broken-reference). This approach might seem daunting at first, but it offers a powerful and direct way to communicate with your computer.

Imagine using a CLI as if you're texting with your computer: you type in your request, and it responds directly with text output.Let's consider a couple of examples of computer interaction to highlight the distinction between a GUI and CLI:

1. **Opening an application:**
   * **GUI**: You might simply double-click on the application's icon.
   * **CLI**: You would issue a command like `open -a "application_name"`.
2. **Moving a file:**
   * **GUI**: This could involve using the drag-and-drop paradigm.
   * **CLI**: You'd invoke a command like `mv file.txt ~`.

Given the much steeper learning curve of the CLI compared to the GUI, you might wonder why it isn't obsolete. Well, there are a few reasons:

* **Speed:** Once you're familiar with commands, the CLI can be much faster than using a mouse.
* **Automation:** The CLI makes it easy to automate repetitive tasks.
* **Remote Access:** Remote computer interaction is much more efficient in a CLI.&#x20;
* **Power:** Some CLI commands have no GUI equivalent.
