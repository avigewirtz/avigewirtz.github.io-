# Linking

The linker plays a crucial role in the process of transforming source code into an executable program, especially when the program involves dependencies, such as libraries or multiple source files. After compiling the individual source files into object files, which contain machine code and other related information, the linker combines these object files and resolves dependencies to create a single, coherent executable file. The main responsibilities of the linker include:

1. Combining object files: When a program consists of multiple source files, each file is usually compiled separately into an object file. The linker combines these object files into a single executable, arranging the code and data sections appropriately.
2. Resolving external symbols: Object files often contain references to external symbols, which are functions or variables defined in other object files or libraries. The linker searches for these symbols in the provided object files and libraries, and resolves their addresses, replacing the references with the correct memory addresses.
3. Handling libraries: Many programs rely on libraries, which are collections of pre-compiled code that provide commonly used functionality. The linker searches for the required library functions in the specified libraries and includes only the necessary code in the final executable, thereby avoiding code duplication and reducing the executable's size.
4. Address assignment: The linker assigns the final memory addresses for the code, data, and other sections of the executable. These addresses are used to resolve relative memory references and calculate the absolute addresses for jumps, calls, and other memory-related operations.
5. Generating executable files: The linker creates the final executable file in a format suitable for the target platform, such as ELF (Executable and Linkable Format) for Unix-like systems or PE (Portable Executable) for Windows systems. This executable file contains the machine code, data, and other necessary information required to load and run the program on the target platform.
