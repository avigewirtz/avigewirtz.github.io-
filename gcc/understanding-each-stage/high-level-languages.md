# High-level Language

High-level languages like C offer several advantages over assembly language, making them more suitable for a wide range of software development tasks. Some of the key benefits include:

1. Abstraction: High-level languages provide a higher level of abstraction compared to assembly, allowing programmers to focus on the problem they are trying to solve rather than the low-level details of the hardware. This abstraction simplifies the coding process and helps developers write code more efficiently and intuitively.
2. Portability: Code written in high-level languages like C is more portable than assembly. The compiler or interpreter for the high-level language takes care of translating the code into the appropriate machine code for the target platform, allowing the same code to be compiled and executed on various platforms with little or no modification.
3. Readability and maintainability: High-level languages have a more natural and human-readable syntax, making it easier for developers to read, understand, and maintain the code. .
