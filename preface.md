# Preface

## Target Audience

This book is specifically designed for students currently enrolled in _COS217: Introduction to Programming Systems_. As such, it presupposes familiarity with fundamental programming concepts covered in COS126, such as variables, control structures, loops, and functions.

### Assumed Framework

All code examples in this book have been executed on the armlab computer, running the Red Hat Linux distribution. While these examples are anticipated to function on other Unix-like operating systems, such as macOS, minor variations may arise.

## Conventions used
