# Preface

## Target Audience&#x20;

This book is specifically designed for students currently enrolled in _COS217: Introduction to Programming Systems_. As such, it presupposes familiarity with fundamental programming concepts covered in COS126, such as variables, control structures, loops, and functions.

### Assumed Framework

All code examples in this book were executed on the armlab computer, which runs on the Red Hat Linux distribution. Although the examples are expected to work on any other Unix-like operating systems, such as macOS, subtle variations might occur.

## Conventions used

_Italic_

Indicates new terms, URLs, filenames, and file extensions.

`Constant width`

Used for program listings, as well as within paragraphs to refer to program elements such as variable or function names, data types, environment variables, statements, and keywords.

All-CAPS:&#x20;

Indicates a placeholder--that is, text that should be replaced with user-supplied values (i.e., `mkdir DIRECTORY_NAME`).
