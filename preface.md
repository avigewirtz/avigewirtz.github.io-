# Preface

## Target Audience&#x20;

This book is specifically designed for students currently enrolled in _COS217: Introduction to Programming Systems_. As such, it presupposes familiarity with fundamental programming concepts covered in COS126, such as variables, control structures, loops, and functions.

### Assumed Framework

All code examples in this book have been executed on the armlab computer, running the Red Hat Linux distribution. While these examples are anticipated to function on other Unix-like operating systems, including macOS, minor variations may arise.

## Conventions used

_Italic_

Indicates new terms, URLs, filenames, and file extensions.

`Constant width`

Used for program listings, as well as within paragraphs to refer to program elements such as variable or function names, data types, environment variables, statements, and keywords.

All-CAPS:&#x20;

Indicates a placeholder--that is, text that should be replaced with user-supplied values (i.e., `mkdir DIRECTORY_NAME`).
