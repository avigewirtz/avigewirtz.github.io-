# Commit ID

In the previous section, we saw that each commit is named by a seemingly random 40 digit hex number, such as `f4c3b4d5e6f7a1b2c3d4e5f6a7b8c9d0e1f2a3b4`. In fact, however, this number is hardly random. It’s is a hash value generated by feeding the commit object into a hash function known as SHA-1 (Secure Hash Algorithm 1).

Here’s how it works. When a commit is made, Git collects all the commit information, which includes a reference to the snapshot of the content itself, the commit message, the author's details, and the timestamp of the commit, and feeds it into the SHA-1 hash function. Based on the content of the commit, the SHA-1 hash function computes a 40 digit hex number and returns it to Git. Git then uses this 40 digit hex number, known as a hash, to name the commit.

The most important property of SHA-1, as it relates to Git, is its deterministic nature: the same input will always produce the same hash, and different inputs will always produce different hashes. This has a couple of important implications. First, it makes comparing commits easy. Because each commit is uniquely identified by its hash, if the two commits have the same hash, they are identical; if they have different hashes, they are different. Second, the SHA-1 hash ensures the integrity of the data. For example, when information is sent over a network, the recipient can compute the hash of the received data and compare it to the hash sent with the data. If the hashes do not match, it indicates that the data was altered or corrupted during transmission.
