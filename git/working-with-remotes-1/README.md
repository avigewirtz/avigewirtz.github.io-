# Working with remotes

* could be a personal copy
* could be shared repository



Until this point, we've worked entirely within a single repository. One of the core features of Git is it's support for collaborative workflows. That is, a workflow consisting of multiple programmers, each with their own working copy of the project, and enabling them to sync up their work.&#x20;

in context of data exchange, repository youre working in is local and other is remote.&#x20;

## Distributed VCS

For many reasons, however, this is a bad idea. However, even in a distributed system, still use centralized that nobody works in. such as repository is called a bare repository. simply means it has no working tree.

As we stated earlier, in a typical collaborative workflow with Git, each developer has their own local copy of the repository, and they all sync up their repositories via a central repository located on some server.&#x20;

The most common place to host Git repositories is GitHub. In such a workflow, the central repository is uploaded to github perhaps in an organization account or perhaps in one of the collaborastors accounts. GitHub is accessible 24/7 and offers many features that aid on top of Git. In this tuturial, won't focus much on github.&#x20;
