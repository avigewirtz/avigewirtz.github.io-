# GitHub

At its core, GitHub is a Git hosting plastform.&#x20;



benefits of hosting on GitHub:

* **Showcase or share** your work.
* Let others **review** your code, and make suggestions to improve it.
* **Collaborate** on a shared project, without worrying that your changes will impact the work of your collaborators before you're ready to integrate them.
