# Obtaining a Git Repository

There are two ways you can acquire a Git repository:

1. You can create a new Git repository.
2. You can clone (copy) an existing Git repository.

Creating a repository entails initializing a Git repository for a project that is not currently under Git version control. Cloning a Git repository, on the other hand, entails duplicating an existing repository; as such, it comes populated with the source repository's files, history, and other metadata.
