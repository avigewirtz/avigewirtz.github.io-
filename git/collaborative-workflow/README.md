# Collaborative workflow

Until this point, we've worked entirely within a single repository. One of the core features of Git is it's support for collaborative workflows. That is, a workflow consisting of multiple programmers, each with their own working copy of the project, and enabling them to sync up their work.&#x20;

in context of data exchange, repository youre working in is local and other is remote.&#x20;

## Distributed VCS

For many reasons, however, this is a bad idea. However, even in a distributed system, still use centralized that nobody works in. such as repository is called a bare repository. simply means it has no working tree.
