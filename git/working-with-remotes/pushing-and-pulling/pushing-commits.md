# Pushing Commits

Once you have committed your changes, you'll want to push the files to the remote repository to keep the remote repository up to date and (potentially) share your work with others. Pushing the files means transferring the commits you've made locally to the remote repository.&#x20;

\


In COS217, you will at a minimum want to push your changes at the end of each assignment. To do so, run:

| git push |
| -------- |

This pushes to the remote repository's default branch

Common options:&#x20;

1. Pushing to a specific remote repository and branch:

| git push remote\_name branch\_name |
| ---------------------------------- |

Replace remote\_name with the name of the remote repository (usually "origin" for the default remote) and branch\_name with the name of the branch you want to push.
