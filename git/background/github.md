## GitHub

GitHub is an online platform that hosts Git repositories. The benefit of hosting repositories online is it makes them more accessible to others. The starter code and files for each COS217 assignment is uploaded as a Git repository on the COS 217 GitHub account.

## Git vs. GitHub

While Git and GitHub are closely associated with each other, it is important to understand that they are two distinct .

A few key differences between them:

1. Git is a VCS, while GitHub is a platform that (primarily) hosts Git repositories.
2. Git is a program that can be stored locally and accessed without an Internet connection; Github is a platform hosted on Microsoft servers that requires an Internet connection to access.
3. While Git primarily focuses on version control, GitHub extends its capabilities by offering additional features such as enhanced project collaboration, project management, and code review.
4. Git is an open-source software project maintained by GNU; Github is a web-based platform owned by Microsoft.

In summary, Git is the underlying version control system used to manage repositories, while GitHub is an online platform that hosts Git repositories and provides additional tools for collaboration.
