# Getting Documentation for Git Commands

If you ever need assistance with a Git command, you can use the `git help` command to obtain a comprehensive _manpage_ for that command. Type `git help` followed by the name of the command you want documentation for. For example:&#x20;

```bash
git help add
```

If you don't need extensive documentation for a command but instead are looking for a brief overview of its available options, you can use the `-h` option:

```bash
git add -h
```
