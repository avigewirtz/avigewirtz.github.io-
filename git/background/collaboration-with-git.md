# Collaboration with Git

The previous example assumed that we're working entirely with one repository. In practice, development often involves several people, each of whom have their own copy of the repository. In this setting, the workflow has an added compinent of exchnaging data between each other. The git terms of pushing and pulling. When your repository gets data we call it pulling, and when you give data we call it pushing.&#x20;

Let's use an example of three people. Each has their own working copy and repository. Each one develoipes localy, commiting as needed. At any point, they can sink up parts or the entirety of their repositories by pushing and pulling.&#x20;

While it is techincally possible for each of these users to push and pull dircetly between repositories, the better and standard approach is to use a central repository&#x20;
