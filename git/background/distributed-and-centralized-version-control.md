# Distributed and Centralized Version Control

&#x20;There are many different version Control Systems out there but they generally fall into two broader categories most of the older version control systems are centralized meaning that in the typical workflow everyone working on the project has their own working directory but they all synchronize their work through a central repository on a server in contrast most newer version control systems are distributed meaning that everyone has their own working directory but then they also each have their own repository and the snapshots the revisions created in these local repositories get pushed and pulled meaning sent and requested from one repository directly to another so Andrew working in his working directory checks in his changes to his local repository and then he can push that revision into say Lisa's repository or he can retrieve revisions he can pull revisions from Lisa's Repository now even in a distributed system if you have many people working together you'll generally want some Central repository through which everyone can sync otherwise revisions would have to be sent individually out to everyone else which is inefficient and cumbersome notice in the diagram here that the central repository generally doesn't have a working directory of its own because well no one would use it it would just be a waste of space now as for the actual Version Control Systems in use here's&#x20;
