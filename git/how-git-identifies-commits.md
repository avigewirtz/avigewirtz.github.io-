# Commit ID

In the previous section, we saw that commits are named by a 40 digit hex number, like `f4c3b4d5e6f7a1b2c3d4e5f6a7b8c9d0e1f2a3b4`. This 40-character hexadecimal number that looks like a random string of digits and letters. However, it's far from random. This hash is generated by feeding the commit's content—everything from the changes made to the files, the commit message, the author's details, and the timestamp—into the SHA-1 has function.

#### SHA-1 Hash Function

SHA-1 Hash Function is a cryptographic function that works as follows. It takes an arbitrary sized string as input and produces as output a 40 digit hex number. It has the following properties:

* Same input always produces same hash.
* Different input always produces different hash.&#x20;
* Slight change to input (as small as modifying a single character) produces completly different hash.&#x20;
