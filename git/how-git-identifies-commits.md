# Commit ID

In the previous section, we saw that each commit is named by a seemingly random 40 digit hex number, such as f4c3b4d5e6f7a1b2c3d4e5f6a7b8c9d0e1f2a3b4. In fact, however, this number is hardly random. It’s is a hash value generated by feeding the commit object into a cryptographic hash function known as ShA-1.  


Here’s how it works. When a commit is made, git takes the commit object, which includes everything everything from the changes made to the files, the commit message, the author's details, and the timestamp of the commit, and feeds it into the SHA-1 hash function. The hash function outputs a 40 digit hex number. No matter the size of the input, it always outputs a 40-digit hex number. Git then uses this hex number to identify the commit. 

The SHA-1 hash function has the following properties:

- The same input always produces the same hash value. 
* Different input always produces different hash. 
* Slight change to input (as small as modifying a single character) produces completely different hash.
