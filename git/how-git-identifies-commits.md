# Commit ID

In the previous section, we saw that each commit is named by a seemingly random 40 digit hex number, such as f4c3b4d5e6f7a1b2c3d4e5f6a7b8c9d0e1f2a3b4. In fact, however, this number is hardly random. It’s is a hash value generated by feeding the commit object into a hash function known as SHA-1.  


Here’s how it works. When a commit is made, git takes all commit information, which includes a reference to the snapshot of the content itself, the commit message, the author's details, and the timestamp of the commit, and feeds it into the SHA-1 hash function. Based on the content of the commit, the SHA-1 hash function computes a 40 digit hex number and returns it to Git. Git then uses this 40 digit hex number, known as a hash, to name the commit. 

The most important property of SHA-1, as it relates to Git, is that the same input always produces the same hash, and different input always produces a different hash. There are two main benefits to this. first, it makes it easy to compare two commit objects. Just compare the hash. second, it ensures integrity of data. for example, if information is sent over a network, can compute the hash on the receiving end. if it doesn't match, you know data was corrupted.
