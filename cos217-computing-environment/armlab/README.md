# Armlab

Armlab is a Linux-based computer cluster maintained by Princeton's Computer Science department. The cluster consists of two interconnected computersâ€”armlab01 and armlab02.

As a student in COS217, you are assigned a user account on Armlab, which you'll use to develop and submit your C and assembly programs. The purpose of using Armlab in CO217 is to ensure a standardized computing environment for everyone in the course.

To access Armlab, you log in from your personal computer by establishing an SSH connection over a network (Figure 1).

While you work on Armlab, Linux provides the illusion that you're the only user. In reality, many users may be logged in concurrently. Armlab is an extremely powerful computer, running on something of the order of 96 CPUs, so it has no problem handling many users.
